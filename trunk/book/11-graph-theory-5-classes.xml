<title>Paths and cycles</title>

<text>
Paths and cycles are important kinds of graphs, often obtained as subgraphs of larger graphs:
</text>

<list>

<item>
A path <eqn>P_n</eqn> is a graph of order n and size n-1 whose vertices can be labeled <eqn>v_1, v_2, ..., v_n</eqn> and whose edges are <eqn>v_iv_{i+1}</eqn> for <eqn>i=1,2,...,n-1</eqn>. Some authors call them <q>line graphs</q>. In them, all internal nodes have degree 2, whereas the nodes at the extremes have degree 1. Paths are strongly connected and it is easy to see that an Eulerian path exists from the first to the last node in the path.
</item>

<item>
A cycle <eqn>C_n</eqn> is a graph of order n and size n whose whose vertices can be labeled <eqn>v_1, v_2, ..., v_n</eqn> and whose edges are <eqn>v_1v_n</eqn> and <eqn>v_iv_{i+1}</eqn> for <eqn>i=1,2,...,n-1</eqn>. Due to their topology, they are often called <q>rings</q>. In ring graphs, all their nodes are connected to their predecessor and successor nodes, hence their degree is always 2. As paths, cycles are strongly connected and they are also Eulerian graphs, since the full cycle completes an Eulerian tour through the graph. It should be noted that <eqn>C_3</eqn> is the smallest possible cycle, of length 3. <eqn>C_3</eqn> is often referred to as a triangle or triad.
</item>

</list>

<text>
Albeit the topology of paths and rings looks similar, since they just differ in a single link, their properties are quite different. In rings, there are two different paths between any pair of nodes. This reduces the average path length between pairs of nodes, from <eqn>(n+1)/3</eqn> in paths to <eqn>(n+1)/4</eqn> for odd-length rings and <eqn>n^2/(4n-4))</eqn> for even-length rings <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>. It also influences the robustness of the network, since a single link removal disconnects a path, which has a bus-like topology if the use the common terminology in computer networks, while we would have to remove two links to split a ring into two buses.

<!-- Regular graphs -->

<title>Regular graphs</title>

<text>
When all the nodes in a graph have the same degree (say r), the graph is said to be a regular graph,
more precisely an r-regular graph. A regular graph is said to be regular of degree r when its nodes have the degree r.
</text>

<text>
The cycles or rings we have just analyzed, <eqn>C_n</eqn>, are the simplest example of regular graphs, 2-regular graphs in this case.
</text>

<text>
It is easy to see that r-regular graphs with <eqn>n</eqn> nodes contain <eqn>r*n/2</eqn> links. 
</text>

<text>
For small values of r, r-regular graphs are sparse, since their size is proportional to their order; i.e. <eqn>m = r*n/2 \in O(n)</eqn> for small values of <eqn>r</eqn>. For large values of r, however, r-regular graphs are dense, being complete graphs the densest possible graphs.
</text>

<text>
If we define the graph density as the ratio between the links it contains and the number of links in a complete graph, i.e. <eqn>d(G)=m/(n(n-1))</eqn> for simple graphs, the density of an r-regular graph is <eqn>d(R)=r/(2n-2)</eqn>. In other words, their density grows linearly with <eqn>r</eqn> while, in general, it grows sublinearly for arbitrary graphs.
</text>

<text>
When <eqn>r</eqn> is even, an r-regular graph can be decomposed into <eqn>r/2</eqn> disjoint cycles of size <eqn>n</eqn>. The same is not true for odd values of <eqn>r</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
The following theorem establishes the existence of regular graphs for given values of r and n: For integer r and n, there is an r-regular graph of n nodes if and only if <eqn>0 \leq r \leq n-1</eqn> and r and n are not both odd. The last condition is just a consequence of the fact that every graph must have an even number of nodes with odd degrees.
</text>

<text>
At the opposite extreme of the spectrum of regularity, an graph would be irregular if <eqn>deg(u) \neq deg(v)</eqn> for every two vertices of the graph. Such a graph, however, cannot exist, given that an irregular graph with n nodes would have a degree sequence given by <eqn>deg(v_i)=i-1</eqn>. This would imply that one node in the graph would be isolated, i.e. <eqn>deg(v_1)=0</eqn>, which is a contradiction with the fact that <eqn>deg(v_n)=n-1</eqn>, since <eqn>v_1</eqn> should also be adjacent to <eqn>v_n</eqn>.
</text>

<document>
<title>Complete graphs</title>

<text>
In a complete graph, every two distinct edges are adjacent, i.e. the size of a complete graph of order <eqn>n</eqn> is <eqn>n(n-1)/2</eqn>. The complete graph of order <eqn>n</eqn> is denoted by <eqn>K_n</eqn>. 

The complete graph Kn has n vertices (that is, |V | = n) and all two-element subsets of V as edges. 

The graph <eqn>K_n</eqn> is <eqn>(n-1)</eqn>-regular and its size is <eqn>n(n-1)/2</eqn>. Its (vertex) connectivity and edge connectivity are maximum: <eqn>\kappa(K_n) = \lambda(K_n) = n-1</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
Complete graphs are the densest possible graphs because they contain the maximum number of links if we do not allow multiedges and loops. Since every node is connected to every other node, their average path length is 1.
</text>

<list>

<item>
The simplest complete graph, <eqn>K_2</eqn>, with two nodes and a single link connecting them, is the <q>barbell</q> (due to the similarity of its drawing to the bar used in weightlifting with heavy discs attached at its ends).
</item>

<item>
The next complete graph, <eqn>K_3</eqn>, is just a cycle of length three, sometimes denoted by <eqn>C_3</eqn> and also known as a triangle or triad.
</item>

<item>
The complete graph with four nodes,<eqn>K_4</eqn>, can still be depicted without line crossings, hence it is a planar graph.
</item>

<item>
The following complete graph, however, is not planar: No matter how you try to draw <eqn>K_5</eqn>, some lines will necessarily cross. Since <eqn>K_5</eqn> is 4-regular, it can be decomposed into two <eqn>C_5</eqn> cycles.

++ tournament (orientation of a complete graph)

J: "Replacing each edge of the form (a, b) by an undirected edge {a, b}, we obtain the underlying multigraph |G|. Replacing parallel
edges in |G| by a single edge, we get the underlying graph (G). Conversely, let G = (V,E) be a multigraph. Any directed multigraph H with |H| = G is
called an orientation of G. Replacing each edge ab in E by two arcs (a, b) and (b, a), we get the associated directed multigraph
\overrightarrow{G}; we also call \overrightarrow{G} G the complete orientation of G. The complete orientation of Kn is called the complete
digraph on n vertices."

<title>Cubic graphs</title>

<text>
A cubic graph is a graph in which all vertices have degree three, i.e. a 3-regular graph. Cubic graphs are also called trivalent graphs.

Their (vertex) connectivity and edge connectivity always coincide, i.e. <eqn>\kappa(K_n) = \lambda(K_n)</eqn>, and they can be either 1 or 2.

There are many well-known individual cubic graphs, including the complete graph <eqn>K_4</eqn>, the utility graph (<eqn>K_{3,3}</eqn>), the Petersen graph, the Heawood graph, the Möbius-Kantor graph, the Pappus graph, the Desargues graph, the Nauru graph, the Coxeter graph, the Tutte-Coxeter graph (a.k.a. Tutte eight-cage), the Dyck graph, the Foster graph, or the Biggs-Smith graph.

For instance, the Petersen graph is an undirected small regular graph, named after the Danish mathematician Julius Petersen, who initiated the study of regular graphs in 1891. The Petersen graph, which includes 10 vertices and 15 edges, is often employed as an useful example or counterexample for many proofs in graph theory.

<title>Triangular graphs</title>

J: he triangular graph Tn has as vertices the two-element subsets of a set with n elements. Two of these vertices are adjacent if and only if their intersection is not empty. Obviously, Tn is a (2n-4)-regular graph. 

Tn has even stronger regularity properties: the number of vertices adjacent to two given vertices x, y depends only on whether x and y
themselves are adjacent or not. Such a graph is called a strongly regular graph, abbreviated by SRG.

SRG: Tn has parameters a = 2n - 4, c = n - 2 and d = 4, where a is the degree of any vertex, c is the number of vertices adjacent to both x and y if x and y are adjacent, and d is the number of vertices adjacent to x and y if x and y are not adjacent. Let G be an SRG with parameters a, c, and d having n vertices. Its complementary graph \overline{G} is also an SRG. 

Theorem: a(a - c - 1) = (n - a - 1)d.

<title>Lattices</title>

<text>
Wikipedia: The terms lattice graph, mesh graph, or grid graph refer to a number of categories of graphs whose drawing corresponds to some grid/mesh/lattice, i.e., its vertices correspond to the nodes of the mesh and its edges correspond to the ties between the nodes.
</text>

<text>
e.g.

+ Square grid graph

A common type of a lattice graph (known under different names, such as square grid graph) is the graph whose vertices correspond to the points in the plane with integer coordinates, x-coordinates being in the range 1,..., n, y-coordinates being in the range 1,..., m, and two vertices are connected by an edge whenever the corresponding points are at distance 1. In other words, it is a unit distance graph for the described point set (a unit distance graph is a graph formed from a collection of points in the Euclidean plane by connecting two points by an edge whenever the distance between the two points is exactly one.)

A square grid graph is a Cartesian product of graphs, namely, of two path graphs with n - 1 and m - 1 edges.[1] Since a path graph is a median graph, the latter fact implies that the square grid graph is also a median graph. All grid graphs are bipartite.
A path graph may also be considered to be a grid graph on the grid n times 1. A 2x2 grid graph is a 4-cycle.[1]


+ A triangular grid graph is a graph that corresponds to a triangular grid.

+ A Hanan grid graph for a finite set of points in the plane is produced by the grid obtained by intersections of all vertical and horizontal lines through each point of the set.

+ The rook's graph (the graph that represents all legal moves of the rook chess piece on a chessboard) is also sometimes called the lattice graph.

+ The hypercube graph Qn is a regular graph with 2n vertices, which correspond to the subsets of a set with n elements. Two vertices labelled by subsets W and B are joined by an edge if and only if W can be obtained from B by adding or removing a single element.
Each vertex of Qn is incident to exactly n edges (that is, Qn is n-regular), so, by the handshaking lemma the total number of edges is 2n-1n.
The name comes from the fact that the hypercube graph is the one-dimensional skeleton of the geometric hypercube.
Hypercube graphs should not be confused with cubic graphs, which are graphs that are 3-regular. The only hypercube that is a cubic graph is Q3.
· Another definition of Qn is the Cartesian product of n two-vertex complete graphs K2.
· every hypercube Qn is Hamiltonian for n > 1.
· every hypercube is a bipartite graph
· is planar (can be drawn with no crossings) if and only if n &lt;= 3.
e.g. The graph Q0 consists of a single vertex, while Q1 is the complete graph on two vertices and Q2 is a cycle of length 4. The graph Q3 is the 1-skeleton of a cube, a planar graph with eight vertices and twelve edges.

<title>Bipartite graphs</title>

<text>
A graph G is bipartite if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two disjoint sets V_1 and V_2 (called partite sets) so that every edge in G joins a node in L with a node in R.
</text>

<text>
If a bipartite graph is regular, then |L|=|R| and its size will be r|L|=r|R| assuming that it is r-regular. 
</text>

<text>
A bipartite graph is said to be a complete bipartite graph if it is bipartite and uv is an edge of G if and only if u \in L and w \in R.

The complete bipartite graph Ks,t has as vertex set the disjoint union of a set V1 with s elements and a set V2 with t elements; edges are all the
sets {a, b} with a in V1 and b in V2. 

Since the size of the complete bipartite graph <eqn>K_{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor, \lceil n/2 \rceil}</eqn> is <eqn>\lfloor n/2 \rfloor \cdot \lceil n/2 \rceil = \lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor</eqn>, no bipartite graph can have a larger size than <eqn>\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor</eqn>.

From the previous result, we can conclude that every graph with more than two nodes and size larger than <eqn>\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor</eqn> necessarily contains a triangle.

Obviously, the graph Ks,t is regular only if s = t (in that case, it is s-regular).

<title>Trees</title>

<text>
Trees are connected acyclic graphs.

- connected graph with n-1 edges and n nodes.
- every edge is a bridge, since there are no cycles.
- every two nodes are connected by a unique path.

DEFINITION

Let G be a graph with n vertices. Then any two of the following conditions imply the third:
(a) G is connected.
(b) G is acyclic.
(c) G has n - 1 edges.
graph T for which the conditions of Theorem 1.2.8 hold is called a tree.
A vertex of T with degree 1 is called a leaf.  ++ Juningkel Chapter 4.
</text>

<text>
Let (d1, . . . , dn) be a sequence of positive integers. Show
that there is a tree on n vertices having degrees d1, . . . , dn if and only if
d1 + . . . + dn = 2(n - 1),
</text>



<text>
A forest is a graph without cycles, i.e. a graph whose connected components are trees. Obviously, a forest of n nodes with k connected components has n-k links.
</text>


<text>
Trees are recursive structures, since cutting any edge leaves two smaller trees.
</text>


<text>
++ Rooted vs. free:

- Rooted trees define a hierarchical order, emanating from a single source node
identified as the root.
- Free trees do not encode any structure beyond their connection topology.
</text>

<text>
J: Directed trees can never be strongly connected; here, of course, a digraph
G is called a tree if its underlying graph |G| is a tree. If G has a root r, we call G a directed tree, an arborescence or a branching with root r.

Clearly, given any vertex r, an undirected tree has exactly one orientation as a directed tree with root r.
</text>

<text>
There are several well-known classes of trees:
</text>

<list>
<item>Paths <eqn>P_n</eqn>, which are the trees with the minimum number of leaves (just <eqn>2</eqn> of them).</item>
<item>Stars <eqn>K_{1,n-1}</eqn>, which are the trees with the maximum possible number of leaves: <eqn>n-1</eqn> leaves.</item>
<item>Double stars, i.e. a tree containing exactly two non-leaves, which must be adjacent.</item>
<item>Caterpillars, when the removal of the tree leaves produces a path (the spine of the caterpillar). Paths, stars, and double stars are also caterpillars.</item>
</list>

By f(n, s) we denote the number of forests G having n vertices and exactly s connected components,
for which s fixed vertices are in distinct components; in particular, the number
of trees on n vertices is f(n, 1). Cayley's theorem gives a formula for the numbers f(n, s)

<document>
<title>Prüfer codes</title>

<text>
As a corollary, we can conclude that the number of trees on <eqn>n</eqn> vertices is <eqn>n^{n-2}</eqn>, which is also the cardinality of the set of
words of length <eqn>n-2</eqn> over an alphabet with <eqn>n</eqn> elements. We can then specify a bijection between both sets: the set of trees with <eqn>n</eqn> nodes and the set of words of length <eqn>n-2</eqn> over <eqn>n</eqn> symbols. The Prüfer code is such a bijection and it allows us to represent trees as strings of <eqn>n-2</eqn> integers.
</text>


<text>
++ Prüfer codes (parents) [Prü 1918]

J: As we will need an ordering of the elements of V , we assume in what follows, without loss of generality, that V is a subset of N.
Thus let G = (V,E) be a tree. 

For n = 2 the only tree on V is mapped to the empty word; that is, we put \pi_V (G) = (). For n \geq 3 we use the smallest leaf of G to construct a tree on n-1 vertices. We write v = v(G) = min{u \in V : deg_G(u) = 1} and denote by e = e(G) the unique edge incident with v, and by w = w(G)
the other end vertex of e.

Now let G' = G \ v. Then G' has n-1 vertices, and we may assume by induction that we know the word corresponding to G'
under the Prüfer code on V' = V \ {v}. Hence we can define recursively \pi_V (G) = (w, \pi_{V'} (G'))

It remains to show that we have indeed constructed the desired bijection. We need the following lemma which allows us to determine the minimal leaf of a tree G on V from its Prüfer code: 

Let G be a tree on V . Then the leaves of G are precisely those elements of V which do not occur in \pi_V (G). In particular,
v(G) = min{u \in V : u does not occur in \pi_V (G)}.
</text>

<text>
EXAMPLES: shows some trees and their Prüfer codes for n = 6, one for each isomorphism class <cite>Jungnickel 2007</cite>,
- (1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6)))))) = (2,3,4,5)
- (1 (2 (3 (4 (5 6))))) = (2,3,4,4)
- (1 (2 (3 (4 5 6)))) = (2,3,3,3)
- (1 (2 (3 (4)) (5 (6)) )) = (2,3,2,5)
- (1 (2 (3 4 (5 6)))) = (2,2,4,4)

NOTE: There are two models for generating data such as permutations: ranking/unranking (biyective function) and incremental change methods (iterators). Ranking/unranking methods make it trivial to generate random data (just generate a random number and rank), whereas enumeration by incremental change methods makes it tricky to generate random data (e.g. needed to solve some hard problems using randomized algorithms)

<title>Directed acyclic graphs</title>

<text>
++ Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a.k.a. partial orders or posets, arise in many applications, e.g. scheduling and planning
</text>

<text>
Let <eqn>(M,\preceq)</eqn> be a partially ordered set, a poset for short. This is a set M together with a reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive relation <eqn>\preceq</eqn>. This set corresponds to a directed graph G having vertex set M and the pairs (x,y) with x \preceq y as edges. Because of transitivity, G is acyclic.
</text>


<text>
+ Topological sorting orders the vertices of a DAG respecting the precedence constraints imposed by the arcs in the DAG.

J: common problem is to check whether a given directed graph is acyclic
and, if this is the case, to find a topological sorting of its vertices. That is, we
require an enumeration of the vertices of G (labelling them with the numbers
1, . . . , n, say) such that i &lt; j holds for each edge ij. Such a sorting exists for every directed acyclic graph.
</text>

<text>
+ Let G be a directed acyclic graph. Then G contains at least one vertex with din(v) = 0.

JJ: we may choose a vertex v with din(v) = 0. Consider the directed graph H = G\ v. Obviously, H is acyclic as well and thus can be sorted topologically, using induction on the number of vertices, say by labelling the vertices as v2, . . . , vn. Then (v, v2, . . . , vn) is the desired topological sorting of G.
</text>

<text>
J: Each partially ordered set may be embedded into a linearly
ordered set.
Proof. Let (v1, . . . , vn) be a topological sorting of the corresponding directed
acyclic graph. Then vi . vj always implies i &lt; j, so that v1 . . . . . vn is a
complete linear ordering

<title>Planar graphs</title>


<text>
J: Let E be a set of line segments in three-dimensional Euclidean space and V the set of end points of the line segments in E. Identifying each line segment with the two-element set of its end points, we can consider (V,E) as a graph. Such a graph is called geometric if any two line segments in E are disjoint or have one of their end points in common.
Lemma 1.5.1. Every graph is isomorphic to a geometric graph.
</text>

<text>
J: We call a geometric graph plane if its line segments all lie
in one plane (often allows not only line segments, but
curves as well, e.g. they are necessary to represent multigraphs). 
Any graph isomorphic to a plane graph is called planar 
</text>

<text>
J: Thus,
the planar graphs are exactly those graphs which can be drawn in the plane
without additional points of intersection between the edges

Planar graphs, i.e. those that can be drawn on a plane without link crossings, are common in many applications. 
</text>

<text>
J: If we omit the line segments of G from the plane surface on which G is drawn, the remainder splits into a number
of connected open regions; the closure of such a region is called a face.

n vertices, m edges and f faces. Then n - m + f = 2.

e.g. Euler's formula was applied to the vertices, edges and faces
of a convex polyhedron, which are planar; it is used, for example, to determine the five regular

J: A subdivision of a graph G is a graph H which can be derived from G by
applying the following operation any number of times: replace an edge e = ab
by a path (a, x1, . . . , xk, b), where x1, . . . , xk are an arbitrary number of new
vertices; that is, vertices which were not in a previous subdivision. For convenience,
G is also considered to be a subdivision of itself.

J: Two graphs H and H' are called homeomorphic 
if they are isomorphic to subdivisions of the same
graph G.

J: the famous characterization of planar graphs:

Kuratowski's theorem: A graph G is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph which is homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3.

W: Two important characterizations of planar graphs, Kuratowski's theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither K3,3 nor the complete graph K5 as a subdivision, and Wagner's theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither K3,3 nor K5 as a minor, encompass this result.

J: another interesting characterization of planarity. If we identify
two adjacent vertices u and v in a graph G, we get an elementary contraction
of G; more precisely, we omit u and v and replace them by a new vertex w
which is adjacent to all vertices which were adjacent to u or v before
the resulting graph is usually denoted by G/e, where e = uv.
A graph G is called contractible to a graph H if
H arises from G by a sequence of elementary contractions. 

Wagner's theorem: A graph G is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph which is contractible to K5 or K3,3.
