<title>Models of Network Formation</title>


<text>
L: random graphs have random structure, and k-regular graphs have purely deterministic structure. In between these two extremes lie two important classes of graphs: the class of small-world (mostly structured, partly random), and the class of scale-free (mostly random, partly structured) graphs. Each class has its own characteristic property: the Poisson distribution for random graphs, powerlaw distribution for scale-free graphs, high average cluster coefficient for small-world graphs, and zero-entropy value for k-regular graphs.
