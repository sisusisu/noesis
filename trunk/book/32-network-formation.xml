++
<cite>Watts and Strogatz 1998</cite> created a simple model that originates small worlds + discovered that these patterns are present in a broad range of networks. 

Algorithm: initially construct a graph with regular structure. Next, apply rewiring to every link with probability p, such that p*m links are randomized (redirected to a randomly selected node). Parameter p is the rewiring probability, and m is the number of links in the original regular graph.

L: increasing p also increases the randomness of the small world. This means we can produce a network with any desired level of randomness—entropy, if you will—by adjusting rewiring probability p—a low rewiring probability generates a nonrandom structure, and a high probability generates a random structure

L: At a certain rewiring probability called the crossover point (also length scale), the network transitions from mostly structured to mostly random network. Typically, the crossover point is very small—on the order of 2-3%. Watts and Strogatz attached a meaning to the crossover, suggesting that it corresponds to phase transition in materials (the crossover point is also known as the phase transition threshold).

L: Watts and Strogatz: small worlds as networks with relatively short distances (hops) between node pairs chosen at random, even as the size of the network grows. Specifically, the diameter of a network increases as ln(n) while its size increases by O(n), where n is number of nodes.

an exact formula for the power law of a purely scale-free network and showed that
it describes many biological systems (Dorogovtsev, 2000; 2002a; 2002b; 2003).

Networks are considered to be small worlds when they have a high clustering coefficient but exhibit a similar path length when compared to random networks with the same number of nodes and links.

L: Kleinberg gives a formal explanation for Milgram's experiment based on
the "Manhattan distance" between source and target nodes. The "Manhattan distance"
is defined as the number of blocks, traversed along streets in Manhattan,
New York, between source and destination intersections. Kleinberg showed that it
takes only O(n) steps to navigate such a small world (Kleinberg, 2002a).

Strogatz claimed that the beating of a human's heart, the chirping of crickets, and
other biological systems naturally sync because they are small-worlds (Strogatz,
2003). But today we know that network synchronization has little to do with small-world
topology, and everything to do with the Laplacian of the connection matrix, and
the length of circuits within the network.

ref. Atay networks (Atay, 2006), We examine stability of Atay networks,
which have applications in marketing, as well as understanding the chirping of crickets,
and show that sync is a property of emergent networks that contain triangleshaped
subgraphs. As it turns out, small-world networks have an abundance of
triangular subgraphs! Moreover, a network can be synchronized, by adding a triangular
subgraph to one of its nodes.

<text>
Anthropologists such as Elman Service, when studying cultural evolution, envision chiefdoms being formed when several villages were bound by commerce. The village located at the nexus would naturally become the richest and would gradually grow dominant <cite>Wright 2000</cite>. This <q>rich get richer</q> effect is pervasive in networks...
</text>

<text>
A wide range of real-world networks have been found to exhibit power-law degree distributions: the World Wide Web, citation networks, cellular metabolism networks...
</text>

<text>
A power law implies that the probability of finding a node with a degree that is twice as large as a given number decreases by a constant factor, rather than following an exponential falloff. ++ exponent of the power law distribution.

L: "the probability that a site has k links obeys a power law, which drops off quickly for large k"
... A network that follows a power-law distribution means that it has a
hub, and many other nodes with many fewer links than the average. This lopsided
preference for hubs seemed counter to nature, which typically follows a normal distribution.

</text>

<text>
IDEA: The fluctuations in degree are unbounded, i.e., the standard deviation is bounded only by the finite size of the graph.
</text>

<text>
<cite>Clauset et al. 2009</cite> examine how power laws are best detected in practice: regression analysis of linear relationships in log-log scale (the standard method) results in many false positives (e.g. networks that might be better approximated by exponential or log-normal distributions). Sampling might also introduce false negatives <cite>Stumpf et al. 2005</cite>.
</text> 

<text>
The <q>scale-free</q> term refers to the fact that nodes in a scale-free network do not have a characteristic scale. You can zoom in on any segment of the distribution and it does not change its shape.

L: scale-free networks... The name came from observing that a function f(x) scales if f(ax) = a*f(x), which is
what a power law does. Therefore, if the degree sequence distribution obeys the power law, h(x) = x ^-q, then it is clear that h(ax) = (ax)^-q = (a ^-q)h(x) = a' h(x).

L: "a microrule called preferential attachment - that the probability a site will obtain a new link is directly proportional to the number of links it already has" (the <q>rich get richer</q> phenomenon).


<cite>Barabasi and Albert 1999</cite> demonstrated that power-law degree distributions can be generated by a <q>preferential attachment</q> growth process. This process is a well-known example of how local processes can determine the global properties of complex networks. 

L: Yule first observed preferential attachment in evolution (Yule, 1925): Darwinian algorithm = Connect the new node to an existing node with probability proportional to the number of links already connected to the existing node, i.e. its degree
[Yule, G. U., A Mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. B 213:21-87 (1925).]
++ Yule-Simon distribution

L: Preferential attachment describes an emergent process—that is, a process that results in a network topology that is not apparent by examination of the local algorithm, or microrule. It is not at all obvious that the result of repeated application of preferential attachment will result in a network with a degree sequence distribution that follows a power law. This realization would come 70 years later, when A.-L. Barabasi and R. Albert showed how to create a scale-free network by repeated application of preferential attachment.
</text>

<text>
++ Linear preferential attachment yields scale-free networks with an exponent of 3. Refined attachment rules that vary node attractiveness yield scale-free networks with exponents between 2 and 3.
</text>

<text>
++ When new links involve a cost, i.e. they cost energy or occupy space, the degree distribution becomes truncated for high degrees <cite>Amaral et al. 2000</cite>. Networks that exhibit a scale-free behavior only through a range of node degrees are called broad-scale networks.

L: the idea of nonrandomness as a factor in behavior and the connection between preferential attachment and nonrandom distributions occurred to Simon in 1955 [Simon, H. A., On a class of skew distribution functions, Biometrika 42(3/4):425-440 (1955).]

L: Albert, Jeong, and Barabasi observed that scale-free networks were extremely resilient
against random attacks, but extremely vulnerable to systematic attacks on hubs
(Albert, 2000). This makes sense—a random attack will most likely strike and destroy
a node with only a few links, because a scale-free network has many such nodes. On
the contrary, since hubs are rare, it is unlikely that a hub is attacked. But a hub has
many links, and so its demise damages a large percentage of the network. Let pc
be the fraction of damaged nodes that dismantles the network. When pc is high,
the network is resilient, because many nodes must be knocked out to dismantle the
network. When it is low, the network is vulnerable. In simulations, Albert et al.
found threshold values of pc = 28% for random networks versus nearly 99% for
scale-free networks under random attacks; that is, a random network dismantles
when an average of 28% of its nodes are damaged. But the tables are turned when
hubs are systematically attacked—only 18% of the nodes need to be attacked to dismantle
a scale-free network. Thus, a scale-freenetwork is more vulnerable than a
random network when its hubs are targeted.

2000 Albert, Jeong, Barabasi: Scale-free networks are resilient if hubs are protected (Internet's "Achilles heel")
  [Albert, R., H. Jeong, and A. L. Barabasi, The Internet's Achilles' heel: Error and attack tolerance of complex networks, Nature 406:378-382 (2000).]
</text>

<text>
L: In related work, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani observed that populations forming
a scale-free network have no minimum epidemic threshold that prevents an infectious
disease from recurring (Pastor-Satorras, 2001). Once an infection enters a network, it
rises and falls repeatedly. Persistent epidemics are real—they occur in human networks
as well as on the Internet.


2001 Pastor-Satorras, Vespignani: Claim no epidemic threshold in scale-free networks; Internet susceptible to SIS viruses
  [Pastor-Satorras, R. and A. Vespignani, Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86(14):3200-3203 (2001).]
</text>

<text>
L: Wang and coworkers showed the initial claim of Pastor-Satorrus to be generally
false (Wang, 2003a). Instead, persistence of an infection is determined not by the network's
degree sequence but by its spectral radius, which is defined as the largest nontrivial
eigenvalue of a network's connection matrix. Therefore, network topology
determines its susceptibility to epidemics, but not because it is scale-free. This profound
result has significant implications for fighting both kinds of viruses—Internet
and human. It also has implications for the product marketer.

<text>
<cite>Sole and Valverde 2004</cite> arrange network classes in a qualitative space by considering three dimensions: randomness, heterogeneity, and modularity. The first introduces the amount of randomness involved in the process of network's building. The second measures how diverse is the link distribution and the third would measure how modular is the architecture. The position of different examples are only a visual guide. The domain
of highly heterogeneous, random hierarchical networks appears much more occupied than others. Scale-free like networks belong to this domain.

Each class results from a different formation process and exhibits different patterns of behavior. 

Not all niches in this space are occupied by real-world networks (empty regions might correspond to unrealistic growth strategies or unstable network configurations).
