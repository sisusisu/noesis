Many textbooks describe at least part of the material mentioned in this chapter.

<cite>Skiena 2008</cite>, <cite>Kleinberg and Tardos 2005</cite>
<cite>Even 2011</cite> discusses many basic graph algorithms known before 1979.
<cite>Tarjan 1983</cite> book provides a survey of both algorithms and data structures.
<cite>Gibbons 1985</cite>
<cite>Sedgewick 1990</cite> in C, <cite>Sedgewick 2002</cite> and <cite>Sedgewick 2003</cite> in Java (2nd volume devoted to graph algorithms)

</text>


<text>
<cite>Grama et al. 2003</cite> includes a chapter on parallel graph algorithms.

Network flow; monographs <cite>Ahuja et al. 1993</cite> <cite>Ford and Fulkerson 1962</cite>; surveys <cite>Goldberg et al. 1990</cite> <cite>Schrijver 2002</cite>; original algorithms <cite> Ford and Fulkerson 1956</cite> <cite>Edmonds and Karp 1972</cite>

Matching:  The concept of a matching in a graph is very fundamental and forms
the cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, with an entire book devoted
to it <cite>Lovasz and Plummer 1986</cite>
</text>


<text>

Many graph problems (such as shortest paths, bipartite matching, or network flows) can also be solved as special cases of linear programming.

The books by <cite>Papadimitriou and Steiglitz 1982</cite> and <cite>Ahuja et al. 1993</cite> provide a
comprehensive coverage of combinatorial optimization problems. 

Hochbaum's edited collection <cite>Hochbaum 1996</cite> provides an extensive coverage of work on approximation
algorithms for graph problems.

Conferences: Many international conferences carry articles on recent advances in graph
algorithms. Some of them are the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer
Science (FOCS), the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), the ACM-SIAM
Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), and the International Colloquium on
Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP).
