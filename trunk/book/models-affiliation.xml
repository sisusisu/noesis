<title>Affiliation networks</title>

<text>
Affiliation networks (a.k.a. membership networks) are a special kind of two-mode network: bipartite graph, actors + events the actor is associated to (e.g. organizations, clubs, meetings, groups...). Events, therefore define subsets of actors, whose belonging to the group can be described by means of a binary affiliation variable (for each relevant subset).
