<title>Graph Theory: The Mathematics of Networks</title>


<text>
From a formal point of view, network theory rests on two main bodies of knowledge: graph theory and game theory. Graph theory...
K: two main bodies of theory that we will be building on: graph theory and game theory. These are theories of structure and behavior, respectively.
Graph theory is the study of network structure, while game theory provides models of individual behavior in settings where outcomes depend on the behavior of others.

Graph Theory is the mathematical study of graphs (or networks).

[idea] A graph as a mathematical representation of a system composed of interconnected elements. Applications: human interactions, transportation systems, communication networks, electronic circuits... They can be used to represent any kind of relationship.
