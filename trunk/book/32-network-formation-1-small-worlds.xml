<title>Small-world networks</title>


<text>
In general, the term small-world effect refers to networks where the average path length grows slower than any positive power of the number of nodes in the network. Or, alternatively, to networks whose number of nodes grows faster than any power of its average path length.
In fact, the small-world effect is often observed as a rapid decline in average path length when a small number of random links are added to a  network, even when it is random. This result is not completely surprising, since a single link connects separate parts of a network and brings distant nodes closer.

<title>Watts-Strogatz model (WS)</title>

<text>
++
<cite>Watts and Strogatz 1998</cite> created a simple model that originates small worlds + discovered that these patterns are present in a broad range of networks. 

L: The canonical form of the WS algorithm
starts with a 2-ring network (each node connected to 2 nodes on its right and 2 on its left). 

A small-world network emerges from the 2-ring
network by randomly rewiring pm links, where p is the rewiring probability. The
random rewiring injects a (limited) amount of randomness into the regular
network. As it turns out, a very small amount of randomness goes a long way.


Algorithm: initially construct a graph with regular structure. Next, apply rewiring to every link with probability p, such that p*m links are randomized (redirected to a randomly selected node). Parameter p is the rewiring probability, and m is the number of links in the original regular graph.

L: Rewiring probability p is similar to the link probability used to generate the Gilbert random network. However,
instead of determining whether to include a link in the network, rewiring probability p is used to determinewhether one end of a link is switched to a randomly selected node

L: The class of WS small-world networks can be generated with a small amount of
randomness (small p), or a large amount (large p), depending on the value of p.

L: increasing p also increases the randomness of the small world. This means we can produce a network with any desired level of randomness—entropy, if you will—by adjusting rewiring probability p—a low rewiring probability generates a nonrandom structure, and a high probability generates a random structure

L: Each link is visited and rewired (connected
to a randomly chosen head node), with probability p. In the end, this leaves
(1-p)m links as they were (part of the initial 2-ring network), and randomizes
the remaining pm links. The resulting small world is partly structured and partly
random—and so its degree distribution falls in between the spike of a
k-ring network, and the Poisson distribution of a random network.

</text>


<text>
Algorithm:

L: Watts and Strogatz devised the Watts-Strogatz small-world network generation procedure
in 1998; hence the name Watts-Strogatz or WS small-world network.
</text>

<text>
The WS generation procedure is simple—start with a 2-ring network and rewire
a percentage of its links to “randomize them.” The initial 2-ring network has a
and the resulting small-world network has some regular and some random structure. 
</text>



<text>
Rewiring consists
of replacing the head node of a link with a randomly selected different node. Each
link is visited and rewired with probability p; hence, a small-world network
evolves into a semistructured, semirandom network. On the average, pm links are
“random” and (1-p)m links are structured.
</text>

<text>
1. Given n, rewiring probability p, and k = 2, generate a k-ring network by
connecting each of n nodes to their immediate neighbors, and neighbor’s
neighbors. This network has m = 2n links [\lambda = 4, density = (4/n)].

2. For every link m, rewire it with probability p, as follows. If
(Math.random() &lt; p), disconnect the head(m), and rewire it to a different
randomly selected node. Avoid (v_random = head(m)), and duplicate links.
</text>

<text>
L: This generation procedure is simple, but does not guarantee a connected network.
If all links connecting a node to the network are rewired, it is possible for that node to
become isolated. Therefore, a number of enhancements (proposed by a variety of
researchers) can be applied to the basic algorithm to remove this deficiency.For
example, we can modify the WS procedure to avoid rewiring when it would
remove the final link from a node. This is similar to the anchored random network
modification applied to the Erdos-Renyi procedure described in the previous
chapter.

L: Newman et al. modified the procedure to avoid isolated nodes and components,
which led to the NSWS model (Newman, 2000a, 2000b). The Newman et al. generation
procedure is similar to the Gilbert random network generation procedure
because it uses a similar "anchoring" algorithm to avoid the separation of the network
into components.

<title>Generalized Watts-Strogatz model (k-WS)</title>


<text>
L: The density of a small world can be adjusted by modifying the initialization procedure
of WS. Instead of starting with a 2-ring network, we can start with a k-ring
network, where k = m/n. 
</text>

<text>
L: The WS generative procedure assumes an initial 2-ring
network, but we generalize the procedure to allow density to vary, which is achieved
by setting k = (n/m), and starting with a k-ring network (\lambda = 2k).
</text>



<text>
1. Given n, rewiring probability p, and k =m/n, generate a k-ring network by
connecting each of n nodes to their immediate neighbors, and neighbor’s
neighbors. This network has m = 2kn links [l = 2k, density = (2k/n)].

2. For every link m, rewire it with probability p, as follows. If
(Math.random() &lt; p), disconnect the head(m), and rewire it to a different
randomly selected node. Avoid (v_random = head(m)), and duplicate links.
</text>


<text>
Alternative method:

L: round-robin algorithm for inserting links into the k-ring starting network. The value of k depends on the number of nodes and links specified by the user. This requires insertion of k = m/n rings to generate the initial k-ring network.
</text>

<text>
L: The k-WS model is used to study changes in smallworld properties as a function of rewiring probability p and density d.

<title>Structural properties of small-world networks</title>

<text>
Watts-Strogatz networks are hybrids — part k-rings and part random. Therefore, the topology of a small-world network should fall somewhere between that of a k-ring network and random network.
</text>

<text>
Link rewiring... 

L: The dramatic impact that a relatively small amount of
randomness has on path length, clustering, and entropy is the most impressive
attribute of a small-world network... that introduction of a small
amount of randomness or entropy into a structured network leads to a significant
change in the properties of a structured network (


L:  has a dramatic impact on several properties
of interest: degree distribution, diameter, radius, and average path length.
For small rewiring probability p, most of the network remains structured. Because
the k-ring network has a high cluster coefficient, the resulting small-world
network also has a high cluster coefficient. But even a small amount of rewiring
radically decreases network diameter, radius, and average path length, while
retaining most of the clustering inherent in the k-ring network. The
dramatic decrease in diameter, radius, and average path length is known as the
small-world effect.
</text>

<text>
L: Small-world networks are indeed structured networks with the addition of a small
amount of randomness. Some properties of the small-world network are inherited
from the structured network underlying the small world, and others are a consequence
of rewiring. Small worlds owe their average path length to the introduction of randomness,
but other properties, such as cluster coefficient, are due to starting
network topology.
</text>

<text>
WS small-world networks are sparse, yet they exhibit short average path lengths. They also have high clustering coefficients and their degree distribution is similar to that of random networks.

L: Generally, a slightly smallworld
network has a high cluster coefficient and lower average path length than
does its underlying regular network.

L: A small-world graph, G(small world), is a graph with relatively small average path
length, and a relatively high cluster coefficient, CC(G). Generally, the average path
length of a small world grows proportional to O(log(n)/log(lambda)), where where lambda is the mean node degree,
and the clustering coefficient tends to be greater than 50%.

</text>


<text>
L: Watts and Strogatz: small worlds as networks with relatively short distances (hops) between node pairs chosen at random, even as the size of the network grows. Specifically, the diameter of a network increases as ln(n) while its size increases by O(n), where n is number of nodes.

<!-- Degree distribution -->

<document>
<tag>small-worlds-properties-degree</tag>
<title>Degree distribution</title>

<text>
L: A small-world network ... is a slightly structured and partially random network that is closer to the structured end of the spectrum than to the class of random networks that have no discernable structure or topology.

... [expect something between k-ring networks and random networks] ... In this case, intuition is correct, as the degree distribution
of a small-world network is taller and thinner than the distribution of an equivalent random network.

L: The degree distribution of a WS-generated small world is taller and thinner than an equivalent random network
</text>

<text>
L: The degree of all nodes of the initial k-ring network is 2k. Therefore,
the degree distribution is a spike at d = 2k, but this spike begins to
flatten out and spread wider as links are rewired.
</text>

<text>
L:... (1-p)m links as they were (part of the initial 2-ring network), and randomizes
the remaining pm links. The resulting small world is partly structured and partly
random—and so its degree distribution falls in between the spike of a
k-ring network, and the Poisson distribution of a random network.
</text>


<text>
L: Barrat and Weigt (Barrat, 2000) derived a closed-form expression for degree distribution of small worlds by observing the following:
</text>

<list>

<item>
The degree of a typical node u stays the same if none of its links are rewired, and increases if other node's links are redirected to u.
</item>

<item>
The probability that links are not rewired follows a binomial distribution, B(k,i,(1-p)), where k = m/n, i = number of links not rewired, and p = rewiring probability.
</item>

<item>
The probability that another node's links are redirected to node u follows a Poisson distribution, P(\lambda_1, d - k - i); d \geq k, where \lambda_1 = pk is the expected value of redirected links, d = degree, and i = number of links redirected to u
</item>

<item>
The probability of increasing the degree of node u is equal to the joint probability, B(k,i,(1-p))P(\lambda,d-k-i).
</item>

<item>
The degree distribution h(d) is equal to the sum of joint probabilities over i = 1, 2, 3, . . . min{d-k,k} links.
</item>

</list>


<text>
The distribution of nodes with d links after rewiring is the sum:
</text>

<equation>
h(d) = \sum_{i=1}^{min\{d-k,k\}} B(k,i,1-p) P(\lambda_1,d-k-i)
</equation>

<text>
where
</text>

<equation>
\lambda_1 = pk
</equation>

<equation>
B(k,i,1-p) = {k \choose i} (1-p)^i p^{k-i}
</equation>

<equation>
P(\lambda_1,d-k-i) = (pk)^{d-k-i} e^{ \frac{-pk}{(d-k-i)!} }
</equation>

<text>
The above expression is valid for <eqn>d \geq k</eqn> but it is undefined for <eqn>d &lt; k</eqn> and all the values of <eqn>i</eqn> outside the interval <eqn>[k, min\{d-k, k\}]</eqn>, where we assume it to be zero.
</text>

<text>
Generally, the Barrat-Weigt equation provides vales that are slightly lower than those observed in actual small-world networks.
</text>


<!-- Entropy -->


<document>
<tag>small-worlds-properties-entropy</tag>
<title>Entropy</title>

<text>
L: Entropy of the class of small-world networks is scalable from nearly structured
(low entropy) to fully random networks (high entropy). Entropy can be
adjusted by the designer through selection of the WS rewiring probability
p or number of links (density).

</text>

<text>
Starting with a k-ring network k = m/n, with density 2k/(n-1),
</text>

<text>
Varying the rewiring probability from 0 to 100% (constant size and densities):
</text>

<text>
- Nearly one-half of the increase in entropy occurs between 1% and 10% (confirming that a little randomness goes a long way toward dramatically changing the properties of a small-world or random network).

- For sufficiently large rewiring probabilities, 
the experimentally derived semilog plot of entropy versus rewiring probability fits a straight line almost exactly: 
2-ring WS small-world entropy is proportional to log_2 (p)
L: This is intuitively satisfying because it says that the number of bits of entropy in a small world is directly proportional to
rewiring probability p: # bits of entropy \propto p

++ the number of bits of randomness rises from 0 (at p=0%) to approximately 2.9 (at p=100%)
vs. 6.64 bits of information in a random message with 100 symbols, occurring with equal probability 1/100
i.e. no more than half the bits of information in a sequence of random numbers
L: When p = 100%, a WS small-world network is identical, in terms of entropy, to
an equivalent random network with the same number of nodes and links. Unlike a random network, we can “tune” a small world to match the randomness that we want.
</text>

<text>
Varying the density (constant size and rewiring probability):
</text>

<text>
- Entropy rises very slowly with density according to the logarithmic function: H_{WS} \propto \log(density, i.e. H_{WS} \propto \log \left( \frac{kç}{n}  \right). 

- Once again, the number of bits of entropy grows linearly with density: # bits of entropy \propto density
L: ... agrees with intuition because it says that entropy in small-world networks increases to the same extent, regardless of the source of randomness (either rewiring or adding links).

<!-- Clustering coefficient -->

<document>
<tag>small-worlds-properties-clustering</tag>
<title>Clustering coefficient</title>

<text>
The small-world graph has the largest cluster coefficient even though its
degree distribution is very similar to that of a random graph....
The class of small-world graphs is characterized by an unexpectedly large cluster
coefficient when compared to the class of random graphs, but it also has some properties
in common with the class of random graphs. For example, small-world and
random graphs have similar degree distributions and diameters.

The cluster coefficient of a small world can be several orders of magnitude
larger that that of an equivalent random graph of the same size and with an equivalent
number of links.
</text>


<text>
The cluster coefficient of WS networks varies by changing density, rewiring probability, or both. 

First, suppose that we hold density constant while varying rewiring probability p. What happens to a 2-regular WS network when entropy is
increased? Surprisingly, the cluster coefficient decreases as entropy increases!

Alternatively, the cluster coefficient increases with network density because the number of links available to form triangular subgraphs also increases.
</text>

<text>
L: Intuition says that the small-world cluster coefficient should approximate the (high) cluster coefficient of the class of regular networks at one extreme and the (low) cluster coefficient of the class of random networks at the other extreme.
For low rewiring probability, a WS network is mostly regular, and for high probability p, the network is mostly random.

</text>

<text>
Initially, before any rewiring, the cluster coefficient of every node in a 2-ring WS network is the same. The cluster coefficient of the initial k-ring network, CC(WS_0), is equal to the ratio of number of triangles attached to each node, divided by one-third of the number of connected triples:
</text>

<equation>
CC(WS_0) = CC(k-ring) = 3 \frac {\#\text{triangles}} {\#\text{connected triples}} = 3 \frac {k(k-1)} {2k(2k-1)} =  \frac{3}{2} \frac {k-1} {2k-1}
</equation>

<text>
L: For example, k = 2 in the initial network, CC(WS_0) = 1/2. As k increases, the highest possible cluster coefficient is 3/4 because
CC(WS_0) \sim 3k / 4k = 3/4. Therefore, the cluster coefficient of the initial regular WS network will fall in the interval [0.5,0.75].
</text>

<text>
L: When the small world emerges from rewiring, pm links will be rewired, which means that some links have been diverted from triangular subgraphs while
others remain as they were, initially. This causes clustering to decline with corresponding increases in rewiring probability p. When p=1.0, the WS small-world cluster coefficient equals that of a random network. Newman and Watts derived a complex equation for cluster coefficient using a
combinatorial approach (Albert, 2000???): 
</text>

[Albert, R., H. Jeong, and A. L. Barabasi, The Internet’s Achilles’ heel: Error and attack tolerance
of complex networks, Nature 406:378-382 (2000).]
[Albert, R. and A.-L. Barabasi, Statistical mechanics of complex networks, Rev. Mod. Phys.
74:47-97 (2002).]

<equation>
CC(WS_p) = \frac {3k(k-1)} {2k(2k-1) + 8pk^2 + 4p^2k^2}
</equation>



<text>
L: Barrat and Weigt made an elegant and simple assumption that gives a more accurate result: the cluster coefficient is
proportional to the probability that a triangular subgraph will not be rewired (Barrat, 2000):
</text>

[Barrat, A. and M. Weigt, On the properties of small-world network models, Eur. Phys. J. B
13:547 (2000); available as Condensed Matter/9903411.]

<equation>
CC(WS_p) = CC(k-ring) * (1-p)^3
</equation>

<text>
where, as above,
</text>

<equation>
CC(k-ring) = \frac{3}{2} \frac {k-1} {2k-1}
</equation>

<text>
L: When p=0, the initial cluster coefficient is that of the underlying regular network. When p&gt;0, rewiring simply destroys triangles with probability p, and leaves them intact with probability (1-p).  Failure to rewire one link occurs with probability (1-p). Failure to rewire all three links occurs with probability (1-p)^3. All three links have to survive rewiring; otherwise, the triangular subgraph is destroyed. Therefore, rewiring has to fail 3 times. The probability of three failures is (1-p)^3  == the triangular sub-graph remains intact with probability (1-p)^3.
</text>

<text>
Whereas the Newman-Watts  approximation overestimates cluster coefficient, the Barrat-Weigt approximation fits the data much better, but slightly
underestimates the actual clustering coefficient.
</text>

<text>
L: Clustering decreases as randomness increases because clustering is a form of structure (order), whereas rewiring links is a form of randomness (disorder). Increasing rewiring probability increases disorder, which decreases clustering.
</text>

<text>
++ Now let us hold rewiring probability constant and let density vary. Cluster coefficient slowly rises with increase in density because increasing density moves any network closer to a complete network. We know that the cluster coefficient of a complete network is 1.0, so the cluster coefficient must asymptotically approach 1.0 as density approaches 100%. Notice that the bounds on cluster coefficient are increased: 0.5 = CC(density) = 1.0, which seems to contradict to the Barrat-Weigt approximation. In this case k \rightarrow n/2, since (k=n density / 2), so there is no contradiction.
Therefore, the cluster coefficient slowly rises with rising density...
... more links means more triangular subgraphs to begin with, and relatively fewer rewired links for a fixed probability p. As density increases, so does the number of triangular subgraphs, which increases cluster coefficient. 
</text>


<text>
NOTE:  this clustering coefficient is more a property of the underlying regular network than an inherent property of all small worlds. For instance, clustering coefficients would be higher if we started with hypercube or toroidal networks ranteher than a simple k-ring.

Experiment <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>

Start with a 5x5 toroidal network, and apply the same rewiring microrule used in the WS generation procedure. What are the
properties of the resulting network?... The results suggest that initial configuration has some impact on entropy and average path length, but the cluster coefficient is much lower in networks generated by the WS microrule that starts with a toroidal network than with a 2-ring network. The standard WS network model starts and ends with high clustering. The toroidal WS network procedure starts and ends with less clustering.
i.e. the starting network matters = the WS network generation algorithm produces small worlds with the cluster coefficient determined by the topology of the 2-ring network. In general, the underlying k-ring network determines the cluster coefficient of the resulting small world!

<!-- Average path lentgh -->

<document>
<tag>small-worlds-properties-path-length</tag>
<title>Average path length</title>

<text>
Path length rapidly declines as the rewiring probability, and thus the randomness, increases...
</text>

<text>
L: Does a small world become even smaller as more links are “randomized”? 

Actually, the average path length of a WS small-world network decreases exponentially as entropy increases, but it never shrinks below that of an equivalent random network... a small world does indeed become smaller as more links are randomized

As rewiring increases, a small world becomes more randomized and its average path length
approaches that of a random network. But the average path length of a small-world
network is no less than that of an equivalent random network.
</text>


<text>
L: Newman, Moore, and Watts (Newman, 1999a) derived an estimate for describing the average path length of a  small-world based on the following reasoning:
</text>

<list>

<item>
When rewiring is nonexistent, and the initial network is a 2-ring, average path length is n/4k.
</item>

<item>
For very small rewiring probability p, average path length begins a rapid decline, after <eqn>p \geq 1/m</eqn>.
</item>

<item>
At some (early) point <eqn>p^*</eqn>, rewiring is sufficiently large that the network transitions from mostly regular, to mostly random. This is known as the crossover point <eqn>p^*</eqn>, and indicates a phase transition in the network.
</item>

</list>

<text>
Newman, Moore, and Watts (Newman, 1999b; Newman, 2000a) argued that average path length declines from an initial (p=0) value of n/4k according to a scaling function f(r), where r is 2 times the average number of rewired links, r = 2pm, which act as shortcuts:
</text>

<equation>
f(r) = \frac{4}{\beta} tanh^{-1} \left( \frac{r}{\beta} \right)
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>tanh^{-1}</eqn> is the inverse hypertangent function <eqn>arc tanh</eqn> and
</text>

<equation>
\beta = \sqrt{r^2+4r}
</equation>

<text>
Therefore, the average path length of a 2-ring WS small world is approximated by the Newman-Moore-Watts equation:
</text>

<equation>
L(WS) = n \frac{f(r)}{2k} = \frac{2 n}{\beta k} tanh^{-1} \left( \frac{r}{\beta} \right)
</equation>

<text>
with <eqn>r = 2pm</eqn> and <eqn>\beta = \sqrt{r^2+4r}</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
L: The Newman-Moore-Watts equation is proportional to 1/p for large, sparse networks. 

L: The Newman-Moore-Watts expression overestimates average path length, especially as rewiring probability p decreases. However, its underlying assumptions that path length shrinks as rewiring increases suggests an intuitive approach for an alternative appromxation <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>. 
</text>

<text>
L: Average path length is n/4k initially, but as links are rewired, they introduce shortcut
links that divide the network into smaller and smaller subgraphs. Specifically, one
random link cuts the network in half, on average, and two links cut it into one-fourth,
and so on. However, shortcuts overlap, and  addition of rewired links cuts the network into a fraction of 1/2.
The effect on the logarithm of average path length is a logarithmic function of rewired links.
Let r = pm = pkn shortcut links reduce logarithmic growth in path length by
\log_2 (pm), on average, because of the partial bisecting that occurs. Therefore,
the logarithm of the average path length is equal to the logarithm of the path
length of the initial 2-ring network, minus the effects of partial bisection:
</text>

<equation>
\log_2 L(r) =  \log_2 \left( \frac{n}{4k} \right) - q \log (r)
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>q</eqn> is constant. This expression fits a straight line on a log-log plot, where the exponent <eqn>q</eqn> can be approximated by curve fitting. For 2-ring WS networks, <eqn>q_2 \approx 1/3</eqn>, whereas for 4-ring WS networks, <eqn>q_4 \approx 1/6</eqn>. We might conjectture that doubling k halves q...

Rearranging the terms in the expression above, we get an approximation for the average path length of WS networks that is simpler than the Newman-Moore-Watts equation and valid for small values of p:
</text>

<equation>
L(WS) = \frac { n } { 4 k r^q}
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>r = pm = pkn</eqn> and <eqn>q></eqn> is a constant obtained by curve fitting.
</text>

<text>
When <eqn>k=2</eqn>, average path length is inversely proportional to the cube root of the rewiring probability <eqn>p</eqn>, i.e.
</text>

<equation>
L(WS_2) = \frac { n } { 4 k  \sqrt[3]{q}} = \frac { n } { 4 k  \sqrt[3]{pm}} \propto \frac{1}{ \sqrt[3]{p} }
</equation>

<text>
This power law tends to underestimate, while the Newman-Moore-Watts equation tends to overestimate path length.
</text>


<text>
L: WS networks exhibit the small-world effect because of the abrupt
decline in average path length while maintaining the cluster coefficient of
the underlying regular network. 

vs. random networks of equal density

L: An equivalent random network is really an asymptotic extreme of a small-world network with an
average path length less than or equal to an equivalent small world. Small-world
path length shrinks with increasing probability of link rewiring, reaching p =
100% as a limit. At low rewiring probability values, the WS small-world network
path length is similar to that of a 2-ring network (higher than that of a random
network). At high rewiring probability values, the path length of the class of WS
small-worlds and the class of random networks are similar (low).

<title>Betweenness</title>

<text>
L: ...the average betweenness of a small-world network rises, falls, and then rises again, according to density d, size n, mean degree \lambda, and rewiring probability p:
</text>

<equation>
betweenness(WS) \propto \rho \lambda^r
</equation>

<text>
where 
</text>

<equation>
r \propto \frac { \lambda log (n - (1 - p)) } { \log(\lambda) }
</equation>

<text>
L: betweenness in a small-world, unlike a random, network is correlated
with both density and the underlying regularity of the initial k-ring
network.

++ Contrary to intuition, betweenness of a node does not improve the
ability of a message to rapidly find its way through a small-world network.
</text>

<text>
++ L (p.154-156):

Intuitively, average betweenness of nodes in a small world should follow the same
pattern as betweenness in a random network, especially as rewiring probability increases.
But this turns out to be false because of the WS small-world generative procedure,
which has a k-ring network as its underpinning. As density increases, small
worlds become more regular and asymptotically approach a complete network just
as does a random network. But the transition is not smooth... 

In fact, the transition dramatically follows a lazy-Z-shaped curve—completely
unexpected compared to the average betweenness of random and small-world
networks. The small-world network’s cluster coefficient undergoes a nonlinear
transformation at approximately 50% density.

betweenness increases with increasing density—up to a point—and then dips as the
network begins to act more like a k-ring network than a small-world network. After
the dip, regularity takes over, and betweenness once again rises until reaching a peak
near 100% density. A very rough approximation to this nonlinear behavior is obtained
by performing a mean-field analysis, as with random networks.

Here is the strategy:

1. Modify the mean-field approximation obtained in the previous
chapter, betweenness(random) = O((1 - density)z), to accommodate the impact
of regularity on the network, where z = lr, l = mean degree, and
r(random) = O( log (n)= log (l)):

a. Replace (1-density) with density because small worlds increase betweenness as
density increases—up to a point (50%),

b. Note that the transformation from small-world to k-ring network occurs
around r = 1.

c. Use the fact that a direct path of length 1 contributes zero betweenness because
of the way betweenness is defined.

2. Estimate curve-fit parameters C1 and C2

A small-world network of arbitrary density is generated by first constructing a
k-ring lattice. Then, a percentage
of links p are randomly rewired. This random rewiring injects shortcuts through the
network, which leads to a reduction in the number of nodes eligible to lie on a path
between any other pair of nodes. The effect of rewiring pm links is modeled as a
reduction in number of paths, as follows:

r = ( A log2 (n - (1 - p)\lambda) ) / log2 (\lambda)

The mean-field number of paths through a typical node is proportional to z, as before: z = \lambda^r.

When r &lt; 1, the small world ceases to behave like a small world, and becomes
more like a k-ring network, as far as betweenness is concerned. Therefore, we
require a different model for z when r , 1. In fact, the dense small world behaves
more like a k-ring network with k ¼ l=2 direct paths, instead. Therefore, only
k = \lambda / 2 paths run through a typical node: z = k = \lambda / 2

Combining these two effects, we obtain
z = \lambda^r if r &gt; 1 1
z = 2 otherwise

There is a major difference between the betweenness properties of random and small-world
networks. Random networks have no regularity until density approaches 100%. Hence
average betweenness is (mainly) a function of average path length and sparseness. On the
other hand, small-world networks have a great amount of regularity regardless of
density—and the impact of regularity on average betweenness increases as density
increases. A “tipping point” is reached around 50% density, which results in the small
world behaving more like a k-ring network than a random network. This regularity
becomes the most significant factor in determining betweenness. Generally, clustering
tends to increase average betweenness, while randomizing tends to decrease it, beyond
~20% density.

<title>The dynamics of small-world networks</title>


<text>
L: small-world networks share some properties of random networks—such as short
path length—some researchers have jumped to the conclusion they also behave
like random networks. Some of these claims have been verified experimentally.
Some are myths.

<text>
Strogatz claimed that the beating of a human's heart, the chirping of crickets, and
other biological systems naturally sync because they are small-worlds (Strogatz,
2003). But today we know that network synchronization has little to do with small-world
topology, and everything to do with the Laplacian of the connection matrix, and
the length of circuits within the network.

... pursued the idea that small-world network behavior explained synchrony ...

L: Strogatz suggested that the synchronized chirping of a certain species of
crickets is a consequence of the small-world effect (Strogatz, 2003).

ref. Atay networks (Atay, 2006), We examine stability of Atay networks,
which have applications in marketing, as well as understanding the chirping of crickets,
and show that sync is a property of emergent networks that contain triangleshaped
subgraphs. As it turns out, small-world networks have an abundance of
triangular subgraphs! Moreover, a network can be synchronized, by adding a triangular
subgraph to one of its nodes.

<title>Phase transition</title>

<text>
L: Phase transition in the physical world occurs when matter changes from a solid state
to a liquid, from liquid to gas, and so on. The Ising effect, for example, explains the
phase transition that occurs when inert iron converts into magnetic iron. The idea is
related to the sudden transition from a 2-regular to random network as rewiring probability
increases. Watts argued that phase transition is a particular property of small
worlds, and that it is the same fundamental phenomenon observed in different fields.
</text>

<text>
L: At a certain rewiring probability called the crossover point (also length scale), the network transitions from mostly structured to mostly random network. Typically, the crossover point is very small—on the order of 2-3%. Watts and Strogatz attached a meaning to the crossover, suggesting that it corresponds to phase transition in materials (the crossover point is also known as the phase transition threshold).


L: Typically, the small-world transitions from purely regular to slightly random for
p* = 1-4%. This phase transition threshold, or crossover point, has taken on a
number of meanings in various applications. For example, phase transition is
claimed to explain the Ising effect—the transition to magnetic polarity in ferrous
materials. It has also been used to explain why small-world networks tend to synchronize
more than do purely random or purely structured networks.



++ 2-ring WS small-world networks transition from regular to random topology near a crossover
rewiring probability p* \sim 1/n. This marks the transition from "mostly
structured” to “mostly random” topology. The value of p is of
interest to physicists, who associate it with phase transitions in materials.
For this reason, small worlds make
good models of phase transition phenomena, such as the transition of a
liquid to a solid, or inert iron to magnetic iron.


The rapid change in network properties as entropy rises begs a number of questions
about WS small worlds and the transition from predominantly structured networks,
to partially structured, and then fully random networks.
++ does this phenomenon occur in the transition from other structured networks to small worlds, or is it dependent on the initial 2-ring lattice? - ++

L: Kleinberg gives a formal explanation for Milgram's experiment based on
the "Manhattan distance" between source and target nodes. The "Manhattan distance"
is defined as the number of blocks, traversed along streets in Manhattan,
New York, between source and destination intersections. Kleinberg showed that it
takes only O(n) steps to navigate such a small world (Kleinberg, 2002a).

L: Navigation of a network using local properties of nodes is faster using a
maximum-degree selection algorithm than a minimum-radius, maximumbetweenness,
or random selection algorithm. In the study performed in this
chapter, WS small-world networks are shown to be more difficult to navigate
than random or scale-free networks. While small worlds tend to have relatively
short average path length, it is more difficult to find the shortest path through a
small world using local information such as node degree, betweenness, and node
radius than equivalent random networks. This has profound implications for
packet-switching communication networks.
