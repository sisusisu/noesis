<title>Kinds of networks</title>

<text>
++ Application domains with different terminology:
- Communication engineers think of networks as systems of routers and switches; 
- sociologists think of networks as influence diagrams representing the social interactions among humans;
- marketing business people think of networks as populations of buyers; 
- physicist thinks of networks as models of phase transition, magnetism...
- Biologists use the network metaphor to understand epidemics, genetics, and metabolic systems within cells
- Power engineers think of electrical power grids.

The first use of the <q>social network</q> term is often attributed to John Arundel Barnes <cite>Barnes 1954</cite>, an anthropologist who conducted a field study to analyze the social structure and decision-making processes in Bremnes, a small island in western Norway. Since then, social networks denote patterns of ties that encompass many concepts used by the social sciences, including bounded groups (e.g., tribes or families) and social categories (e.g., gender or ethnicity).
</text>

<text>
Sociometry can be considered to be the precursor of social network analysis (and much of social psychology), as it was founded to measure interpersonal relations in small groups of people. Jacob Levy Moreno, the founder of sociometry, also pioneered the use of <q>sociograms</q> in the 1930's, e.g. <cite>Moreno and Jennings 1938</cite>. Sociograms are standard graph drawings used to depict the social links that determine the interpersonal structure of groups.
</text>

<text>
Widely used in the social and behavioral sciences, social network analysis focuses on the relationships among social entities <cite>Wasserman and Faust 1994</cite>. Depending on the particular context, these social entities can be individuals belonging to groups, corporations making economic transactions with other corporations, or nations signing treaties and trade agreements. The key ingredient in social network analysis is its focus on relationships, in contrast to reductionist approaches that limit their attention to the attributes of individual social entities.
</text>

<text>
Kinds of relations in a social network: 
- John Barnes <cite>Barnes 1972</cite>: attitudes, roles, and transactions.
- Knoke/Kuklinski <cite>Knoke and Kuklinski 1982</cite>: individual evaluations (sentiments: friendship, liking, respect...), kinship (family ties: marriage and descent relationships), transactions or transfers of material resources (lending/borrowing, buying/selling, exchange of gifts), transfer of non-material resources (communication, i.e. sending/receiving information, let it be e-mail messages, advice, or mere gossip), interactions (e.g. attending the same event, hitting...), movement (physical, between locations, or social, between occupations), formal roles (boss/employee, teacher/student, doctor/patient...)...
</text>


   


(e.g. e-mail message exchanges and telephone conversations)

Understanding social networks '2012:

"Some of the questions that are addressed, though hardly solved, are: What is the relationship between basic personality constructs and social relations? How do groups form? What is the nature and source of leadership? How can we best describe the way social positions relate to one another? What is the nature of authority in organizations and society? What are the ways of constructing efficient organizations that benefit their stakeholders? What is the nature of community, and how are people world-wide related to one another? How do new ideas spread and develop? What are the basic social resources of individuals and societies and how can they best be utilized? From time to time, we will reference classic social theorists to see to what extent social network ideas illuminate the problems that they posed. In this view, social networks are not only structural abstractions and the study of networks is not an alternative to classic ways of understanding society, but is a way of gaining greater insight into social life. Though networks also characterize the inanimate world such as electrical power grids, social networks have to be understood, to quote <cite>Schumacher 1973</cite>, <q>as if people mattered</q>.




"At each level of analysis—individual, organization, or nation-state, for example—what are the conditions that make it more or less likely that a path will exist between two nodes, that the nodes will have the same attributes, that they will be reciprocally or mutually related to one another, and that triads will be balanced? The answers lie in social theory.

<text>
Topics that have been studied by network analysts: occupational mobility, decision making, group problem solving, consensus and social influence, social perception, social support, community formation, exchange and power, social roles, coalition formation, company interlocking, markets, the world economic system, difussion and adoption of innovations...
</text>


Social scientists have investigated three kinds of networks: ego-centric, sociocentric, and open-system networks. 

- Ego-centric networks are those networks that are connected with a single node or individual,

- Socio-centric networks are networks in a "box." Connections between children in a classroom or between executives or workers in an organization are closed system networks and the ones most often studied in terms of the fine points of network structure. 
- Open system networks are networks in which the boundaries are not necessarily clear, for example, the elite of the United States, connections between corporations, the chain of influencers of a particular decision, or the adopters of new practices. In some ways, these are the most interesting networks. 


<text>
Ego-centered networks (a.k.a. personal or local networks) consist of a focal actor, called ego, a set of alters who have ties to ego, and measurements on the ties among the alters, e.g. Facebook friends or people in your Google+ circles 
++ difference between dichotomous links @Facebook vs. valued links @Google+, e.g. trusty friend, well-known, acquaintance, name associated to face, unknown
++ Applications: study of the social envionment surrounding a given individual (you!) and what social scientists call social support, i.e. how social relationships can affect the emotional and physical well-being of a given individual.
</text>

<text>
Two students of Leslie White, a renowned anthropologists, offer complementary views on the forces behind cooperation of people within societies.
<cite>Wright 2000</cite>. Whereas Robert Carneiro's focus was on pushing people together as the rational response against external threats, Elman Service thought that it was clear in some cases and probable in many others that neighboring societies were pulled together because of economic causes. Either by pushing or pulling people, opportunities for gain originate and draw people in closer cooperation, because of the benefits of participation in the total network. 
</text>

<text>
Jennifer Fewell, from Arizona State University, illustrates the importance of [insect] social networking using a professional basketball example <cite>Fewell and O'Donnell 2009</cite>. Phoenix Suns were successful, in part, because point guard Steve Nash passed the ball quickly to different teammates, making it difficult for defenders to predict their play. However, the Suns immediately started losing the first six games after Shaquille O'Neal joined the team, most likely because he destroyed his team's network dynamics: <q>Everybody there on the floor... knew where that ball was going to go - it was going to go to Shaq.</q> The network dynamics had changed and the success of the team depended on it, so they were forced to change their network dynamics again in order to improve their results with Shaquille O'Neal in the team. <q>It's a good example that the success of individuals depend on the network, and the success of the network depends on individuals. It's not just how good the individuals are... it's how good those interactions among them are as well.</q>

DUNBAR'S NUMBER

– large-scale social networks reliably have high-degree vertices
There must be some limits to degrees
– can't be "close friends" with too many people (150? 1000?)
- Large N, small diameter and limited degrees are in tension (not all combinations are possible)
e.g. Let N be population size, M be the maximum degree, and D be the diameter: if M=2, then D ~ N/4 ( much greatear than 6 or log(N))

++ Dunbar's number: 
+ http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26824/ 
+ <cite>Goncalves et al. 2011</cite> Validation of Dunbar's Number In Twitter Conversations  @ Network structure chapter

Hill and Dunbar argue that "[i]n primates, social networks are more easy to define… and are often delimited by the size of the social group" <cite>Hill and Dunbar 2003</cite>. 
Primate relationships involve intense social grooming. The grooming group size is relative to neocortical volume. "Since the size of the human neocortex is known, the relationship between group size and neocortex size in primates can be used to predict the cognitive group size for humans" (ibid.). Dunbar therefore predicts that preliterate humans should live in groups of about 150 in size <cite>Dunbar 1993</cite>

@ Primates <cite>Dunbar 1992</cite>


Using samples of convenience in Britain and Belgium and such techniques as inquiring about Christmas card sending, and administering tests of cognitive ability, Dunbar and associates confirm the size of about 150, but with a large standard deviation (about 85) for close personal relationships <cite>Roberts et al. 2009</cite> <cite>Stiller and Dunbar 2007</cite> <cite>Hill and Dunbar 2003</cite>. 

The results, however, are based on small data sets of white Europeans whose sampling characteristics are unknown. In a series of interesting studies, Killworth, Bernard and members of their research team have attempted empirically to find the number of persons known to an average contemporary American. Their latest finding is that the number is larger than the historical 150: somewhere around 280. But there is a very wide standard deviation, meaning that some people have a much larger effective circle and some a much smaller one
<cite>Killworth et al. 1990</cite> <cite>Killworth et al. 2006</cite>... 

Recent analyses..., using data from the Killworth et al. studies, but applying a different statistical technique, suggest that the mean size of one’s circle of acquaintances may be as high as 650 for men and 590 for women, again with a highly skewed distribution in which a few people have very large circles <cite>Zheng et al. 2006</cite>
</text>




<text>
+ Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do <cite>Feld 1991</cite>: 

USN: most people believe others have more friends than they do. The explanation is straightforward. People who have many friends are necessarily more likely to be in one’s interpersonal environment than people who have few friends. So looking at my interpersonal environment, I come to the conclusion that most people have more friends than I do

+ FACEBOOK: 4.74 @ Network structure chapter
W: Facebook's data team released two papers in November 2011 which document that amongst all facebook users at the time of research (721 million users with 69 billion friendship links) there is an average distance of 4.74. Probabilistic algorithms were applied on statistical metadata to verify the accuracy of the measurements. It was also found that 99.91% of facebook users were interconnected, forming a large connected component.

<b>E-mail networks:</b>

++ USN: One study, not of the whole world but an HP laboratory’s email network of 430 individuals (still relatively large), with a median number of 10 acquaintances and a mean of 12.9, showed that the communications were largely pegged to the formal hierarchical structure; focusing on individuals with high degree was not an effective connection strategy, rather, one looked to the official hierarchy <cite>Adamic and Adar 2005</cite>

LOL... A theoretical physicist would say that <q>it is dangerous to believe sociologists too much: (i) they have to work with poorly defined and ubjective material, (ii) they have to use poor statistics</q> <cite>Dorogotsev 2010</cite>. Sociologists will also have their own opinions on spherical elephants and other theoretical constructs often employed to simplify complex problems.

Beyond social networks, there is a branch of network theory that deals with the networks that appear associated to physical phenomena, though such networks tend to be considerably simpler than social networks. At least, they are not so messy.

In social networking, personal agency or motivation is a also key factor in establishing social connections. Even organizations vary in the extent to which they actively seek to relate to other organizations and their skilled in this endeavor <cite>Kadushin 2012</cite>.
