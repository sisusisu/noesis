L: Solomonoff and Rappaport were the first to apply the ideas of epidemics to RANDOM networks (Solomonoff, 1951)

L: Gilbert showed how to build a random graph by first constructing a complete graph and then deleting randomly selected links until reaching the desired number of links (Gilbert, 1959)... cumbersome algorithm was quickly surpassed by the elegant and widely promoted algorithm
of Erdos and Renyi (Erdos, 1960).

<!-- Degree distribution -->

L: The general shape... approximates a Poisson distribution because random selection of node pairs is a Poisson process - the probability of
obtaining exactly k successes in m trials is given by the binomial distribution: 

<equation> 
B(k,m) = C {m \choose k } p^k (1-p)^{m-k}
</equation>

B(k,m) is approximated by the Poisson distribution by replacing p with (\lambda/m), in B(k,m), and letting m grow without bound:

<equation> 
H(k) = \lambda^k \frac{e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
</equation>

<text>
where \lambda is the mean node degree and k is the node degree.

L: A network with n nodes is constructed by inserting a link between randomly selected nodepairs. The process is repeated until m links have been inserted.

... it can leave some nodes isolated, and unless it is slightly modified, it can insert duplicate and loop links into the network.
