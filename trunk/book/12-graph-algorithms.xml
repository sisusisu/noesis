<text>
Linked lists are employed to store the neighbors of each node. 
i.e. a directed link (x,y) will appear in x's adjacency list.
i.e. undirected edges (x,y) will appear twice: in both x's and y's adjacency lists.
+ Implemented using pointers/references or dynamic arrays (to reduce memory fragmentation)
</text>

<text>
+ Faster computation of node degrees: <eqn>O(d)</eqn> (vs. <eqn>O(n)</eqn> for adjacency matrix). NOTE: Can be precomputed
</text>

<text>
+ Slower check of edge existence, insertion/deletion of edges: <eqn>O(d)</eqn> (vs. <eqn>O(1)</eqn> for adjacency matrix)

NOTE: Most algorithms can be easily designed so that they do not need to perform such operations, just by scanning all the links in each adjacency list (e.g. see breadth-first and depth-first traversal below).
</text>

<text>
+ Lower memory requirements: <eqn>O(n+m)</eqn> (vs. <eqn>O(n^2)</eqn> for adjacency matrix)

<title>Graph exploration</title>

<text>
A fundamental graph problem: Visiting every node (or link) in a network in a systematic way, i.e. graph traversal.
</text>

<text>
For efficiency, we should not visit the same node repeatedly. For correctness, we should guarantee that every node is eventually visited. IDEA: Keep track of which nodes we have already visited...

<title>Depth-first search</title>

<text>
Implementation: recursion/stack (LIFO: we explore a path until we meet a dead end [i.e. no unvisited neighbors] and then backtrack). Recursion eliminates the need of an explicit stack and provides a neat implementation of the algorithm.
</text>


<text>
EFFICIENCY: <eqn>O(n+m)</eqn> using adjacency lists
</text>



<text>
Time intervals: a clock ticks every time we enter or exit a node and we keep track of the entry and exit times for each node.
</text>

<text>
Properties:

- Time intervals are properly nested: if we enter x before y, we exit y before x; i.e. all nodes reachable from a given node are explored before we finish with it.

- The difference between exit and entry times indicate the number of descendants of any given node. Actually half the time difference is the number of descendants in the search tree.

- For undirected graphs, DFS partitions edges into tree edges and back edges. Tree edges appear in the DFS tree, whereas back edges always point to an ancestor in the DFS tree (never to a sibling nor cousin node, just because all nodes reachable from a given node are explored before we finish with it).

ON UNDIRECTED GRAPHS
</text>

<text>
++ Cycle detection: If there are no back edges, all edges belong to the tree, hence the graph is actually a tree.
</text>

<text>
++ Graph biconnectedness: Articulation vertices (a.k.a. cut-nodes): Vertices whose deletion disconnects the graph connected component (i.e. single points of failure). Graphs without articulation points are said to be biconnected, since they have no single points of failure. A brute force algorithm would remove each vertex and check whether the graph is still connected (an <eqn>O(n(n+m))</eqn> algorithm), albeit a linear algorithm is possible based on DFS if we track the earliest reachable node for each node. If the DFS tree represented the whole graph, all internal nodes would be articulation points. Three situations have to be considered <cite>Skiena 2008</cite>: 

1) root cut-nodes (if the root of the DFS tree has more than one child, then it is an articulation point), 

2) bridge cut-nodes (if v is an internal node in the DFS tree and its earliest reachable node is v, then v is an articulation point)

3) parent cut-nodes (if v is an internal node in the DFS tree and its earliest reachable node is its parent in the tree, then the parent is an articulation point unless it is the root of the DFS tree, i.e. it cuts v and its descendants from the graph).
</text>

<text>
++ Edge biconnectedness: Bridges (in terms of link failures instead of node failures). A single edge whose deletion disconnects the graph is called a bridge. Any graph without bridges is said to be edge-biconnected. Edge (x,y) is a bridge when it is a DFS tree edge and no back edge connects from y or below to x or above.
</text>


<text>
The classic sequential algorithm for computing biconnected components in a connected undirected graph due to John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan (1973) [1] runs in linear time, and is based on depth-first search

In the online version of the problem, vertices and edges are added (but not removed) dynamically, and a data structure must maintain the biconnected components. Jeffery Westbrook and Robert Tarjan (1992) [2] developed an efficient data structure for this problem based on disjoint-set data structures. Specifically, it processes n vertex additions and m edge additions in O(m alpha(m, n)) total time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function. This time bound is proved to be optimal.

++ Topological sorting: A common operation on directed acyclic graphs. Ordering the vertices... (such ordering cannot exist if the graph contains a directed cycle, i.e. no back edges). Each DAG has, at least, one topological sort, which gives an ordering to process each vertex before any of its successors (e.g. precedence constraints). Considering the nodes in the reverse order they are processed by DFS returns a valid topological sort.

</text>

<text>
++ Identifying strongly-connected components: 1) Traverse the graph atarting from any given node to discover the nodes that are reachable from the node. 2) Build a graph G'=(V,E') with the same vertex set but all its arcs reversed; i.e. <eqn>(y,z) \in E' iff (x,y) \in E</eqn>. 3) Perform a traveral starting from v in G', which will result in discovering the set of nodes that can reach v. A graph G is strongly connected if all nodes in G can reach v and are reachable from v.
</text>

<text>
Any graph can be partitioned into a set of strongly-connected components. Using DFS, we can easily identify cycles. If we take into account that all the nodes involved in a cycle must belong to the same strongly-connected component, we can collapse the nodes in the cycle into a single vertex and repeat the process. When no cycles remain, each vertex represents a different strongly-connected component.

HISTORY: In 1964 Nils Nilsson invented a heuristic based approach to increase the speed of Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm was called A1. In 1967 Bertram Raphael made dramatic improvements upon this algorithm, but failed to show optimality. He called this algorithm A2. Then in 1968 Peter E. Hart introduced an argument that proved A2 was optimal when using a consistent heuristic with only minor changes. His proof of the algorithm also included a section that showed that the new A2 algorithm was the best algorithm possible given the conditions. He thus named the new algorithm in Kleene star syntax to be the algorithm that starts with A and includes all possible version numbers or A*. [2]

<title>Minimum spanning trees</title>

<text>
A spanning tree of a graph <eqn>G=(V,E)</eqn> is a subset of <eqn>n-1</eqn> edges from <eqn>E</eqn> that connect all the vertices in <eqn>V</eqn> and, therefore, form a tree. In weighted graphs, where edges have numerical values associated to them, known as weights, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree whose sum of edge values is as small as possible. A tree is always the smallest connected graph in terms of its number of edges (and also the most vulnerable to single failures), while a MST is the cheapest connected graph in term of edge costs.
</text>

<text>
The algorithms in this section can also be adapted to find maximum spanning trees (just negate the weights and the MST in the negated graph is the maximum spanning tree in the original graph), minimum product spanning trees (replace edge weights with their logarithms so that products are converted into sums), or minimum bottleneck spanning tree (i.e. a spanning tree that minimizes the maximum edge weight, by just employing Kruskal's algorithm). 
</text>

<text>
However, other related problems cannot be solved using the efficient algorithms described in this section:
- Steiner trees (when we can add intermediate vertices), NP-hard in general.
- Low-degree spanning tree (i.e. the minimum spanning tree whose maximum node degree is smaller; in case it where a simple path, this problem would be equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian path = TSP, NP-complete)
</text>

<text>
APPLICATIONS: 
- Whenever we need to connect a set of nodes with minimum cost (e.g. transportation networks, communication networks, distribution networks...). 
- Bottleneck spanning trees have applications when edge weights represent costs, capacities, or strengths
- Clustering (e.g. hierarchical clustering)
</text>


<text>
In unweighted graphs (or weighted graphs where all edges have the same cost), any tree is also a minimum spanning tree. Its cost will always be <eqn>n-1</eqn> times the cost of a single edge. In this case, a spanning tree can easily be found by performing any systematic graph traversal (e.g. DFS or BFS).
</text>

<text>
In weighted graphs, efficient greedy algorithms exist than can be employed to identify minimum spanning trees...

(i.e. <eqn>O(n^3)</eqn> for dense graphs, <eqn>O(n^2)</eqn> for sparse graphs)
</text>

<text>
Prim's algorithm:
1) Maintaining a boolean flag to indicate whether a vertex is already in the tree or not, we can test whether the current edge links to a non-tree vertex in constant time, leading to a <eqn>O(n^2)</eqn> algorithm (both for dense and sparse graphs).
2) Optimization: <eqn>O(n \log k)</eqn> on graphs that have only <eqn>k</eqn> different edge costs.
2) The use of priority queues can lead to a more efficient <eqn>O(m + n \log n)</eqn> implementation, by making it faster to find the minimum cost edge at each iteration.
</text>

<text>
Kruskal's algorithm:
1) Union-find data structure for implementing the component test in <eqn>O(\log n)</eqn> = <eqn>O(m \log m)</eqn> time (i.e. needed to sort the edges).
+ Typically faster than Prim's algorithm for sparse graphs
</text>


<text>
Union-find data structure for representing set partitions (a partitioning of elements, say nodes, intro a collection of disjoint subsets):
1) Union: Component merging in <eqn>O(\log n)</eqn>
2) Find: Same component check in <eqn>O(\log n)</eqn>

Solution: Represent each component as a backwards tree, with pointers from a node to its parent (choosing how to merge in order to limit the height of the trees and reduce the effect of unbalanced trees: the smaller tree will always be a subtree of the larger tree; why? height of the nodes in the larger tree stay the same, heights in the smaller tree are increased by one)

Result: We must double the number of nodes to increase the height of the resulting tree, hence the <eqn>O(\log n)</eqn> result

<title>Single source shortest paths</title>

<text>
APPLICATIONS: Finding directions... (note: hierarchical A*)
</text>

<text>
Finding the shortest path from a source node <eqn>s</eqn> to every other node in the network...
</text>


<text>
IDEA: Shortest path from s to t goes through x, then that path contains the shortest path from s to x
</text>

<text>
Similar to Prim's algorithm... each iteration determines the shortest path from s to a new vertex x by minimizing d(s,v)+w(v,x)

In Prim's algorithm, we just take into account the weighte of the edge we add to the MST; in Dijkstra's algorithm, we consider the cost of the whole path from s to x (i.e. the final edge weight plus the distance from s to the tree vertex that is adjacent to the new edge). Dijkstra's algorithm returns a shortest-path spanning tree from s to all the other nodes in the network.

<title>All-pairs shortest paths</title>


<text>
Some problems requite computing the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, e.g. the central node (i.e. the node that minimizes the longest or average distance to every other node) or the network diameter (i.e. the longest shortest-path distance between two nodes in the network). 
</text>

<text>
APPLICATIONS: 
- bounding the amount of time needed to deliver a packet through a network
- transitive closure (reachable vertices can be computing using graph traversal algorithms, an all-pairs shortest path algorithms returns them all in a whole batch, albeit less efficiently).
- pattern recognition problems, e.g. Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm that basically solves a shortest path problem on a DAG.

<title>Network flows: Maximum flow and minimum cuts</title>

<text>
Interpreting weighted graphs as distribution networks where weights represent capacities
</text>

<text>
Network flow problem: The maximum amount of flow that can be sent from s to t in a given graph.
</text>



<text>
IDEA: <b>Augmenting paths</b>
i.e. iteratively find a path of positive capacity from s to t and add it to the flow
- As in a traffic jam, the flow is limited by the most congested point.
- A flow through a network is optimal if and only if it contains no augmenting path.
</text>

<text>
MECHANISM: Directed <b>residual flow graph</b> R(G,f), where G is the graph and f the current flow
i.e. For each edge (i,j) in G with capacity c(i,j) and flow f(i,j), R can contain two edges
- an edge (i,j) with weight c(i,j)-f(i,j) if c(i,j)>f(i,j)
- an edge (j,i) with weight f(i,j)-c(i,j) if f(i,j)>0

An edge (i,j) in the residual flow graph indicates that flow can still be pushed from i to j (its weight determines the amount of its unused capacity). 

A path from s to t in the residual graph (and the minimum edge weight on this path) defines an augmenting path (and the amount of flow that can be pushed).
</text>

<text>
- For each edge in the residual graph: keep track of the amount of flow currently going through the edge as well as any unused capacity (the residual capacity)
- Initialization: create directed flow edges (i,j) and (j,i); initial flows set to 0; initial residual flows set to their capacity in the original graph.
</text>

<text>
ITERATIVE ALGORITHM
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm <cite>Ford and Fulkerson 1956</cite>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm

- Use the augmented path to update the residual graph (transfer the maximum possible volume from the residual capacity = the path edge with the smallest amount of residual capacity; NOTE: adding positive flow to (i,j) reduces the residual capacity of (i,j) but also increases the residual capacity of (j,i), i.e. augmenting a path requires updates to both forward and reverse links along the augmenting path ).
- Terminate when no such augmenting path exists.

As described, even though the algorithm converges to the optimal solution, it may take arbitrarily long (each augmenting path might add only a little to the flow).
</text>

<text>
IMPLEMENTATION (Edmonds-Karp algorithm <cite>Edmonds and Karp 1972</cite>):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm
The algorithm is identical to the FordFulkerson algorithm, except that the search order when finding the augmenting path is defined. The path found must be a shortest path that has available capacity

- BFS to look for any path from the source to the sink that increases the total flow (only consider edges with residual capacity, i.e. positive residual flow)
</text>

<text>
 <cite>Edmonds and Karp 1972</cite> proved that selecting the shortest unweighted augmenting path (a.k.a. shortest geodesic path) guarantees that <eqn>O(n^3)</eqn> augmentations suffice for optimization.

<eqn>O(nm^2)</eqn> running time: each augmenting path can be found in <eqn>O(m)</eqn> time, every time at least one of the <eqn>m</eqn> edges becomes saturated, the distance from the saturated edge to the source along the augmenting path must be longer than last time it was saturated, and that length is at most <eqn>n</eqn>.

Another property of this algorithm is that the length of the shortest augmenting path increases monotonically.

<tag>graph-minimum-cuts</tag>
<title>Minimum cuts</title>

<text>
A set of edges whose deletion separates s from t is called an s-t cut. Since no s-t flow can exceed the weight of the minimum s-t cut, finding the maximum flow is equivalent to discovering the minimum cut. In fact, the maximum s-t flow equals the weight of the minimum s-t cut.
</text>

<text>
Therefore, flow algorithms can be used to solve edge and vertex connectivity problems...

<tag>graph-matching</tag>
<title>An application: Matching problems</title>

<text>
A matching in a graph <eqn>G=(V,E)</eqn> is a subset of edges <eqn>E' \subset E</eqn> such that no two edges in <eqn>E'</eqn> share a vertex.
</text>

<text>
Remember that a graph is bipartite (or two-colorable) if its vertices can be divided into two sets, L and R, so that every edge in the graph connects one vertex from the first set to a different vertex on the second set.
</text>

<text>
APPLICATIONS:
- Assignment problems (jobs to be done and people who can do them, male and female customers of a dating web site...)
</text>

<text>
The largest possible bipartite matching can be found using network flow. Just add a source node s connected to every vertex in L with capacity 1, add a sink node t connected to every node in R, and assign each edge in the bipartite graph a capacity of 1. The maximum flow from s to t determines the largest matching in the bipartite graph.

<note>
<text>
NP (non-deterministic polynomial) is the set of all decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time (or, alternatively, the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a nondeterministic Turing machine). That is, even though any given solution to such a problem can be verified quickly (in polynomial time), there is no known efficient way to discover a solution to the problem.
</text>

<text>
In computational complexity theory, NP-hard problems are, at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP (i.e. any NP problem can be converted into L by a transformation of the inputs in polynomial time or, in theoretical parlance, every problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time). A problem is NP-complete when it is in NP and also NP-hard. Hence, NP-complete is a subset of NP, which is itself a subset of NP-hard.
</text>

<text>
This the P=NP? question is not resolved, and hence we do not know whether solution verification is really easier than solution discovery for NP problems, we could say that NP problems are <q>not-necessarily polynomial time</q> <cite>Skiena 2008</cite>.
</text>

<text>
More general classes exist, such as PSPACE: the set of all decision problems which can be solved by a Turing machine using a polynomial amount of space. Formally, <eqn>P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE</eqn>. Some graph problems are known to be PSPACE-complete, such as the Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP), a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs that are partially observable (i.e. the graph is revealed while it is being explored) that has many practical applications.

<item>Chromatic number / graph k-colorability / vertex coloring: assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Using dynamic programming and a bound on the number of maximal independent sets, k-colorability can be decided in time and space O(2.445^n).[6] Using the principle of inclusionexclusion and Yatess algorithm for the fast zeta transform, k-colorability can be decided in time O(n2^n)[5] for any k. Faster algorithms are known for 3- and 4-colorability, which can be decided in time O(1.3289^n) [7] and O(1.7504^n),[8] respectively. Note that 2-colorable graphs are bipartite graphs and bipartite testing can be performed in linear time.

<item>Edge coloring: assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges share the same color. an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its line graph (a graph that represents the adjacencies between edges of G)</item>

<item>Face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color. a face coloring of a planar graph is just a vertex coloring of its planar dual (a vertex for each plane region of G, and an edge for each edge in G joining two neighboring regions). </item>

<item>Achromatic number: Does a graph G have an achromatic number K or greater? i.e. is there a partition of V into k disjoint sets so that each V_i is an independent set.</item>

<item>Other graph partitioning problems: into triangles, into cliques, into isomorphic subgraphs, into Hamiltonian subgraphs, into forests, into perfect matchings... are also known NP-complete problems.</item>

</list>

<text>
Contrast subtle differences: Eulerian path (easy) vs. Eulerian cycle (hard); bipartite matching (easy) vs. hypergraph matching (hard); shortest paths (easy) vs. longest paths (hard); Hamiltonian path on a graph (hard) vs. on a DAG (easy); the minimum spanning tree (easy), which is the undirected variant of the feedback arc set problem (hard)...
</text>

<text>
Even when a problem is NP-complete, algorithms can be devised that solve them in practice, either by employing a systematic search on the problem space (e.g. employing backtracking or branch-and-bound algorithms with substantial pruning) or heuristic methods that might not find the optimal solution but often return a good-enough one (e.g. simulated annealing). Heuristics are also employed by approximation algorithms that can get reasonable solutions with guaranteed bounds; i.e. the solution they provide is related to a lower bound on the optimal solution and imposes limits on how badly the approximation algorithm might perform.
</text>

<list>

<item>Vertex cover: Greedy algorithm that chooses an edge at random and adds both intervening nodes to the cover. Since one of the incident vertices must always be on the minimum vertex cover, this simple algorithm efficiently returns a cover that is at most twice as large as the optimal cover.
</item>

<item>The Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem: When the triangle inequality holds, we can approximate the TSP solution by employing minimum spanning trees. Such trees, which connect all the nodes in a graph, can be traversed in depth. That traversal provides a non-Hamiltonian cycle whose length is at most twice the optimal cycle (why? deleting any link from the cycle returns a Hamiltonian path, i.e. a tree, whose weight cannot be greater than that of the MST.
</item>

<item>Maximum DAG: The largest possible subset of edges so that the resulting subgraph is acyclic. Any permutation of nodes can be interpreted as a topological sorting of the graph. Removing either left-to-right or right-to-left edges, we keep at least half of the edges in the original graph, hence the solution contains at least half as many edges as the optimum.
</item>

</list>

<text>
Alternative heuristics might even get better results for particular instances of the above problems, albeit more complex heuristics do not necessarily guarantee better results. In fact, the result if often the opposite. It should also be noted that some clever postprocessing of the results provided by approximation algorithms might also be worthwhile, since it might improve the approximate solution without weakening the approximation bound.
