++ Radial drawing (local neighborhood), i.e. a drawing where vertices lie on concentric circles <cite>Brandes et al. 2003</cite>
== radial layouts, after <cite>Wills 1997</cite>

Nodes are placed on concentric circles depending their distance from a given root node.)

twopi@Graphviz draws graphs using a radial layout. 

Basically, one node is chosen as the center and put at the origin. The remaining nodes are placed on
a sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a ?xed radial distance from the previous
circle. All nodes distance 1 from the center are placed on the ?rst circle; all nodes distance 1 from a node
on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so forth.

++ circo (circular layout, after Six and Tollis 99, Kauffman and Wiese 02. This is suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures, such as certain telecommunications networks.)

circo draws graphs using a circular layout (<cite>Six and Tollis 1999a</cite> @ GD'99, <cite>Six and Tollis 1999b</cite> @ ALENEX'99, <cite>Kaufmann and Wiese 2002</cite> @ GD'02). The tool identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a circle. The block-cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive radial algorithm. Edge crossings within a
circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible. 

In particular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a planar layout.

If a node belongs to multiple non-trivial biconnected components, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this is the first non-trivial component found in the search from the root component.
