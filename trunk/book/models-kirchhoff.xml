<title>Kirchhoff networks</title>

<text>
++FLOW: defined as directed-flow
networks where the state of every node is the sum of the values of incoming links
minus the sum of values of outgoing links.

Applications: abstractions of electrical power grids, electromechanical feedback systems, air traffic routes...

L: Chapter 9 @ <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>, <q>Synchrony,</q> pushes the early work of Watts to new levels—claiming that
network synchronization is merely a special case of linear system stability. Simple
eigenvalue tools can be used to determine the stability and synchrony of almost
any linear network.

L: STABILITY it is important that they not blow up—but instead, stabilize quickly
after a disruption or sudden change in the value of one or more nodes. Curiously,
Kirchhoff networks exhibit wildly chaotic behavior followed by sudden synchronization
when the lengths of circuits within the network are relatively prime numbers.
This has important applications to the design of self-stabilizing power grids, selfcorrecting
transportations systems, and perhaps self-repairing biological systems.
