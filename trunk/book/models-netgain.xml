<title>Netgain networks</title>

<text>
L: Chapter 12 @ <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>, <q>Netgain,</q> is an exploration of business
models - relating the famous Schumpeter creative destruction process to an emergent
process, and mapping the Bass and Fisher-Pry equations onto networks. It is comforting
to verify the Bass-Fisher-Pry equations for networks, but furthermore, I
show how these classical models may be extended to multi-product markets and oligopolies.
