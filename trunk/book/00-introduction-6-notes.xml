2005 NRC Definition of network science: Committee on Network Science for Future Army Applications, commissioned by the Board on Army Science and Technology in cooperation with the National Research Council of the National Academies:
<q>organized knowledge of networks based on their study using the scientific method</q> (National Research Council, Committee on Network Science for Future Army Applications: Network Science, Board of Army Science and Technology, National Academies Press, www.nap.edu, 2005).

<cite>Lewis 2009</cite>: <q>Network science, or the science of networks, is the study of the theoretical foundations of network structure/dynamic behavior and the application of networks to many subfields. Currently known subfields include social network analysis (SNA), collaboration networks (bibliographic citations, product marketing, online social networks), synthetic emergent systems (power grids, the Internet), physical science systems (phase transition, percolation theory, Ising theory), and life science systems (epidemics, metabolic processes, genetics).</q>

Related fields: networks incorporates ideas from complex adaptive systems (emergence), chaos theory (synchronization), and mean-field theory (physics)

+ L: Holland defines emergence in general terms as <q>much coming from little</q> (Holland, 1998): A series of microlevel changes accumulate over time, until a macrolevel change in the network is realized. Emergence means that a major change in global properties comes from many small changes at the local level.  <cite>Holland 1998</cite>


Complex adaptive systems (cas) – systems that involve many components that adapt or
learn as they interact – are at the heart of important contemporary problems. The study of cas poses
unique challenges: Some of our most powerful mathematical tools, particularly methods involving fixed
points, attractors, and the like, are of limited help in understanding the development of cas. This paper
suggests ways to modify research methods and tools, with an emphasis on the role of computer-based
models, to increase our understanding of cas. <cite>Holland 2006</cite>



+ L: Networks evolve...  have dynamic properties such as fixed points when they sync. Starting at some initial state, a dynamic network may transition
to a second, third, fourth, and higher state until either cycling back or reaching a final state—its fixed point... networks that reach a fixed point are different from networks that oscillate, forever.
