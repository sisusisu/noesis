<title>Network properties</title>


Common network features:
   Large scale: large collection of individual components (agents in a market, ants in their colony, neurons in the brain, cells in a beating heart, different kinds of cells in the inmune system, web pages...).
   Interactions only through existing links / signaling and information processing
   Distribution (nodes decide their connections) / self-organization.
   Collective behavior / emergence: the whole is more than the sum of its parts (vs. reductionism)

   Continuous evolution / adaptation: change through learning or evolution. (note: nonadaptive complex systems, e.g. weather)

++ Scale, evolution, distribution &amp; interaction through connections...

Complex (emergence + self-organization) vs. complicated (reductionism: the whole understood as the sum of its parts)

Linear vs. nonlinear: A linear system can be understood by understanding its individual parts and putting them together <cite>Mitchell 2009</cite>. 
Nonlinearities lead to systems that are subject to sensitive dependence on initial conditions: measurement errors, no matter how small, lead to inaccurate, even impossible, long-term predictions (chaos theory = deterministic yet unpredictable systems = apparently random behavior from deterministic systems), e.g. weather beyond one week in the future
Origins: Henri Poincaré's work on the many body problem (Newtonian dynamics, 1887), Edward Lorenz's weather models (1963)
Note: Predictions might be impossible at the microlevel, yet macroscopic properties of chaotic systems are still predictable <cite>Mitchell 2009</cite>

Macroscopic properties cannot be inferred directly from the microscopic properties of the network elements. Interactions must be taken into account...



ALGORITHMIC PERSPECTIVE: A more prosaic perspective on networks and complex systems

Reka Albert: Network topology related questions:
- How can we quantitatively describe large networks?
- How did networks get to be the way they are?
- What are the consequences of a specific network organization?
</text>


Some interesting structural properties:
   Connected components: How many? Of what size?.
   Network diameter: Average distance, worst case…
   Node degree distribution
&amp; existence of "hubs" (heavily-connected nodes).
   Groupings (balance between local and large-distance
connections, as well as their roles).


The countless ways in which network structures
affect our lives make it critical to understand:
1. How network structures affect behavior.
2. Which network structures are likely to emerge.


Research problems
   Search on networks
(with partial local information)
   Diffusion problems:
epidemics, social contagion (ideas, fads, products…)
   Analysis of network properties
e.g. robustness/vulnerability


From an algorithmic point of view…

   Objects:
   Ranking (HITS, PageRank…).
   Classification &amp; anomaly detection.
   Clustering &amp; community analysis.
   Object identification (e.g. “entity resolution”).

   Links:
   Link prediction.

   Graphs:
   Subgraph detection.
   Graph classification.
   Graph generation models.
