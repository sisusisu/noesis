<title>Network properties</title>


Common network features:
   Large scale: large collection of individual components (agents in a market, ants in their colony, neurons in the brain, different kinds of cells in the inmune system, web pages...).
   Interactions only through existing links / signaling and information processing
   Distribution (nodes decide their connections) / self-organization.
   Collective behavior / emergence: the whole is more than the sum of its parts (vs. reductionism)

   Continuous evolution / adaptation: change through learning or evolution. (note: nonadaptive complex systems, e.g. weather)

<text>
++ Scale, evolution, distribution &amp; interaction through connections...
</text>

Complex (emergence + self-organization) vs. complicated (reductionism: the whole understood as the sum of its parts)

Macroscopic properties cannot be inferred directly from the microscopic properties of the network elements. Interactions must be taken into account...



ALGORITHMIC PERSPECTIVE

<text>
Reka Albert: Network topology related questions:
- How can we quantitatively describe large networks?
- How did networks get to be the way they are?
- What are the consequences of a specific network organization?
</text>


Some interesting structural properties:
   Connected components: How many? Of what size?.
   Network diameter: Average distance, worst case…
   Node degree distribution
&amp; existence of "hubs" (heavily-connected nodes).
   Groupings (balance between local and large-distance
connections, as well as their roles).


The countless ways in which network structures
affect our lives make it critical to understand:
1. How network structures affect behavior.
2. Which network structures are likely to emerge.


Research problems
   Search on networks
(with partial local information)
   Diffusion problems:
epidemics, social contagion (ideas, fads, products…)
   Analysis of network properties
e.g. robustness/vulnerability


From an algorithmic point of view…

   Objects:
   Ranking (HITS, PageRank…).
   Classification &amp; anomaly detection.
   Clustering &amp; community analysis.
   Object identification (e.g. “entity resolution”).

   Links:
   Link prediction.

   Graphs:
   Subgraph detection.
   Graph classification.
   Graph generation models.
