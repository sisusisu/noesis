Large networks can be decomposed into smaller <q>building blocks</q> or <q>networks-within-networks</q>, commonly referred to as <b>motifs</b>.
</text>

<text>
Every network can be uniquely decomposed into a set of motifs, and the number and distribution of individual motifs can reflect some functional characteristics of the network <cite>Sporns 2011</cite>.

<title>Cliques, plexes &amp; cores</title>

<text>
A <term>k-core</term> is a maximal subgraph whose nodes have at least k connections within the subgraph.

- k-cores are typically nested, as Russian matrioshka dolls.

- 1-cores are connected components.

- 2-cores are connected components without dangling chains.
e.g. trees have no k-cores with k \geq 2.

cf.
The architecture of randomly damaged uncorrelated networks as a set of successively enclosed substructures...
as random damage increases, the highest k-cores disappear (i.e. the best connected areas within the network)

CLIQUES <cite>Skiena 2008</cite>:

1) finding a maximum clique is NP-complete <cite>Karp 1972</cite>. A simple upper bound on the maximum clique in G is the highest vertex degree plus 1. A better upper bound comes from sorting the vertices in order of decreasing degree. Let j be the largest index such that degree of the jth vertex is at least j - 1. The largest clique in the graph contains no more than j vertices, since no vertex of degree &lt; (j - 1) can appear in a clique of size j. To speed our search, we should delete all such useless vertices from G.
SOLUTION: backtracking/branch-and-bound, simulated annealing (approximate solution)

2) "A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be enlarged by adding any additional vertex. This doesn’t mean that it has to
be large relative to the largest possible clique, but it might be. To find a nice maximal (and hopefully large) clique, sort the vertices from highest degree to lowest degree, put the first vertex in the clique, and then test each of the other vertices to see whether it is adjacent to all the clique vertices added thus far. If so, add it; if not, continue down the list. By using a bit vector to mark which vertices are currently in the clique, this can be made to run in O(n+m) time. An alternative approach might incorporate some randomness into the vertex ordering, and accept the largest maximal clique you find after a certain number of trials."


3) DENSE SUBGRAPHS: "Insisting on cliques to define clusters in a graph can be risky, since a single missing edge will eliminate a
vertex from consideration. Instead, we should seek large dense subgraphs - i.e. , subsets of vertices that contain a large number of edges between them. Cliques are, by definition, the densest subgraphs possible. 

The largest set of vertices whose induced (defined) subgraph has minimum vertex degree ge k can be found with a simple linear-time algorithm. Begin by deleting all the vertices whose degree is less than k. This may reduce the degree of other vertices below k, if they were adjacent to sufficiently deleted low-degree vertices. Repeating this process until all remaining vertices have degree ge k constructs the largest high-degree subgraph. This algorithm can be implemented in O(n+m) time by using adjacency lists and a suitable priority queue. If we continue to delete the lowest-degree vertices, we eventually end up with a clique or set of cliques, but they may be as small as two vertices.

- The densest subgraph problem seeks the subset of vertices whose induced subgraph has the highest average vertex degree. The
problem is NP-complete


4) PLANAR GRAPHS cannot have cliques of a size larger than four, or else they cease to be planar. Since each edge defines a clique of size 2, the only interesting cases are cliques of three and four vertices. Efficient algorithms to find such small cliques consider the vertices from lowest to highest degree. Any planar graph must contain a vertex of at most 5 degrees, so there is only a constant-sized neighborhood to check exhaustively for a clique containing it. We then delete this vertex to leave a smaller planar graph, containing another low-degree vertex. Repeat this check and delete processes until the graph is empty.

In this scam, large groups of phony tax returns are submitted in the hopes of getting undeserved refunds. But generating large numbers of different phony tax returns is hard work. The IRS constructs graphs with vertices corresponding to submitted tax forms and edges between any two forms that appear suspiciously similar. Any large clique in this graph points to fraud"

<title>Clustering coefficients</title>

<text>
The clustering coefficient of an individual node measure the density of connections among the node's neighbors <cite>Watts and Strogatz 1998</cite>. Densely connected neighborhoods form clusters around a node.
</text>

<text>
The clustering coefficient measures how many nodes form triangular subgraphs with their adjacent nodes. In its original form, the clustering coefficient is the fraction of fully connected triangles among the node and its neighbors (a.k.a. three-node motifs). The clustering coefficient, therefore, measures how the neighbors of a node are interconnected.
</text>

<text>
L: In social network analysis, high clustering means that friends of friends are linked to one another. It is network science’s way of saying, “Birds of a feather, flock together.”
</text>

<text>
L: Suppose that we compare the number of links connecting a group of k adjacent nodes
to the maximum possible number,which is given by a complete subgraph with (k(k.))/2 links. 
Each subgraph formed around a node in this k-node neighborhood forms a triangular
subgraph if it is complete, and does not form a triangular subgraph if one or
more links is (are) missing. The amount of clustering depends on the number of triangles
found among these neighbors. Let the neighbors of node u be the nodes directly connected
to u. There are degree(u) such neighbors, which means that there are potentially
(degree(u) [degree(u)-1])/2 links among these neighbors. Suppose that the neighbors
share c links; then the cluster coefficient of node u, CC(u), is

CC(u) = 2c / ( degree(u) (degree(u) - 1) )

A more visual way to think of cluster coefficient is the following: A node u with degree(u)
neighbors may be part of c triangular subgraphs, each containing node u as one of the
triangle’s three nodes. Cluster coefficient is the ratio of the actual number of triangular
subgraphs c to the maximum possible number.
</text>

<text>
The clustering coefficient of can be interpreted as the probability that two of its neighbors are adjacent in the network. However, this probability often depends on the node degree. Hence it is often expressed as a degree-dependent function:
</text>

<equation>
C(k) = \langle CC(u)|_{degree(u)=k} \rangle
</equation>


<text>
The cluster coefficient of the whole network CC(G) is the average over all node clustering
coefficients. It is less informative, but it is often employed.
The clustering coefficient reaches it maximum for complete graphs CC(K_n) = 1 and its minimum for trees CC(T)=0 (e.g. stars).
</text>

<text>
Sometimes, the clustering coefficient just counts (three times) the number of triangles in the network, a measure known as transitivity by sociologists:
</text>

<equation>
transitivity(G) = 3 \frac{ \#triangles }{ \#connectedTriples }
</equation>

<text>
It should be noted that each triangle consists of three connected triples, hence the constant 3 in the expression above. The number of connected triples of nodes equals <eqn>\sum_i d_i(d_i-1)/2</eqn> <eqn>= n ( \langle d^2 \rangle - \langle d \rangle)/2</eqn>. Finally, the number of triangles <eqn>T</eqn> can be computed from the adjacency matrix as follows:
</text>

<equation>
T = \frac{1}{6} \sum_i a_{ii}^{(3)} = \frac{1}{6} Tr A^3
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>Tr A^3</eqn> is the trace (the sum of the diagonal elements) of the cube of the graph adjacency matrix.
</text>


<text>
Low-degree nodes can disproportionately influence their neighbors' clustering coefficients, a problem solved by transitivity <cite>Newman 2003</cite>... a collectively normalized variant of the clustering coefficient.
</text>


<text>
Clustering coefficients and trasitivity have been generalized for weighted and directed networks <cite>Onnela et al. 2005</cite> <cite>Fagiolo 2007</cite>.
</text>

<text>
Clustering (segregation) - efficiency (integration) trade-off... Optimal clustering and modularity are incompatible with optimal global efficiency (separate communities do not communicate too much). Local vs. global order (e.g. specialization of subsystems).

<title>Modularity</title>


<text>
Networks with high levels of clustering are often composed of local communities or modules, which consist of densely connected sets of nodes. A module is separated from other modules in the sense that most links connect nodes within the module and only a few links extend beyond the module boundaries. </text>

<text>
A measure of network modularity characterizes the balance of within-module and between-modules connections.

<title>Assortativity</title>


<text>
Mixing in social networks
- assortative: people prefer to associate with others who are like them
- disassortative: people prefer to associate with others who are different

In general mixing is defined in terms of node attributes

Mixing with respect of node degree:
- assortative: high degree nodes tend to be connected to high degree nodes
- disassortative: high degree nodes tend to be connected to low degree nodes

Focus on edge i, denote the excess in-degree of its starting point with ji and the excess out-degree of its endpoint with ki
Mixing is quantified by the assortativity coefficient characterizing the correlation between ji and ki over all i
Similar to a Pearson correlation coefficient
- Positive correlation - assortative,
- Negative correlation - disassortative
</text>

<text>
A measure based on degree <cite>Newman 2002</cite>, defined as the correlation coefficient for the degrees of neighboring nodes, indicates whether edges tend to link nodes of similar degrees (positive assortativity) or high-degree nodes preferentially connect to low-degree nodes (negative assortativity).
</text>


<text>
++ A wide range of empirical networks – whether biological, technological, information-related or linguistic
– generically exhibit important degree-degree anticorrelations (i.e., they are disassortative), the only exceptions
usually being social ones, which tend to be positively correlated (assortative).

Social networks tend to be assortative, technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative.

Mechanisms that influence mixing properties
In social relationships there is a documented attraction between individuals of similar temperament
- Group affiliations can create assortativity
On the WWW or Internet service relationships (directories, connectivity providers) can create disassortativity
- Constraints on the network assembly process (e.g. no multiple edges among pairs of nodes) can cause disassortativity

Stuctural balance, postulated by Fritz Heider in the 1940's <cite>Heider 1946</cite> and Theodore M. Newcomb in the 1950's <cite>Newcomb 1953</cite>, led to research on triples of individuals, since balanced relations are common in empirical work...
</text>

<text>
<cite>Cartwright and Harary 1956</cite> were among the first to quantify structural balance...

Balance theory influenced the development of other structural theories, such as transitivity...
