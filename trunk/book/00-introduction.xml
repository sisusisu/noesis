<title>Mining Network Data</title>


<text>
The study of networks encompasses theories, models, and applications expressed in terms of <q>relational concepts</q> <cite>Wasserman and Faust 1994</cite>. In other words, the relationships defined by the existing links among the elements of a complex system are the fundamental ingredient of networks, where
</text>

<list>

<item>Elements (also known as actors in social network analysis and nodes or vertices in graph theoretical terms) are autonomous but interdependent.</item>

<item>Links between elements (also known as connections, ties, relations, or even <q>relational contents</q>) represent the only channels through which resources can flow, let them be material or immaterial.</item>

</list>

<text>
Connections in a network provide opportunities for and impose constraints on the elements of the network. Ties among elements are primary and attributes of elements are secondary (and they can often be understood in terms of the role they play within the network structure). 
</text>

<text>
Connections in a social network may represent kinship, friendship, liking, interactions, transactions, flow of resources, group co-membership and other kinds of social ties... even several of these at the same time.
</text>

<text>
Nodes in a social network might be people from a given group, departments within a corporation, whole corporations, public agencies, and even nation-states...
</text>

<text>
Most applications focus on networks of elements of the same type (one-mode networks), albeit you could also have networks conformed by elements of different types (multimode networks)...
</text>

<text>
++ Modes = distinct sets of entities on which the structural variables are measured. Single set (uni-mode networks), two sets (two-mode networks) or even more (multi-mode networks). 

The mode of the network = the number of sets of entities on which structural variables are measured.

- Dyadic two-mode networks (two sets of actors: relations are dyads with the first actor in one set and the second actor in a different set).

- Non-dyadic two-mode networks or affiliation networks (one set of actors and one set of events or activities, which define subsets of actors).
</text>

<text>
++ Attributes: structural variables (measured on pairs of actors, i.e. links) and actor variables (a.k.a. composition variables, defined at the level of individual actors [i.e. <q>of the standard social and behavioral science variety</q> <cite>Wasserman and Faust 1994</cite>, those measured in non-network studies]).
</text>

<text>
Modeling units (level at which network data are studied): actor, dyad (pair of actors), triad (triple of actors), subset of actors, the network as a whole.

Need for new data mining techniques ++ Today's data, however, doesn't take the familiar form of the database. <q>The information's not coming at you in a clean tabular form, it's coming at you in a network form.</q> [Chid Apte, director of analytics research at IBM and chair of the KDD'2011 conference]. It arrives in a graph, that records not only the complex connections between nodes but also other types of information in a diversity of formats (e.g. the videos, images, and comments that people post on social networks). Social media may have started the trend toward analyzing such graphs, Apte says, but network data comes from other sources as well-for example, from complex engineering systems such as the electric power grid, water distribution systems, and traffic management systems. <cite>Naone 2011</cite>

1736: Leonhard Euler
++ Konisberg @ 0471648167 [Marcel Danesi] The Liar Paradox and the Towers of Hanoi.pdf
 
 The German city of Königsberg, founded in 1255, was annexed by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II in 1945 and later renamed Kaliningrad in 1946 after the death of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Mikhail Kalinin, one of the original Bolsheviks. The city is on the banks of the Pregel river. Figure <ref>fig-konigsberg</ref>.

"The history of graph theory began in 1736, when Euler [Eul36] first solved the
seven bridges of K¨onigsberg problem.) . In Euler's day there were seven bridges linking the banks and
two islands, which can be modeled as a multigraph with seven edges and four vertices.
Euler sought a way to walk over each of the bridges exactly once and return home - i.e.
, an Eulerian cycle. Euler proved that such a tour is impossible, since all four of the
vertices had odd degrees."

circular walk through the town of K¨onigsberg (now Kaliningrad) in such a way as to cross over each of the seven bridges spanning the river Pregel once, and only once... the precise shapes of the island and the other three territories involved are not important; the
solvability depends only on their connection properties. Let us represent the four territories by points (called vertices), and the bridges by curves joining the respective points; then we get the graph also drawn in Figure <ref>fig-konigsberg-graph</ref>.

Euler gave a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary graph to admit a circular tour of the above kind...

Trees (i.e. connected acyclic graphs) implicitly appeared in the study of currents in electrical networks performed by Gustav Kirchhoff, while Arthur Cailey used them in 1957 to count chemical compounds.

<!-- Hamilton -->

<text>
The icosian game is a mathematical game invented in 1857 by William Rowan Hamilton. The game's object is finding a Hamiltonian cycle along the edges of a dodecahedron such that every vertex is visited a single time, no edge is visited twice, and the ending point is the same as the starting point. The puzzle was distributed commercially as a pegboard with holes at the nodes of the dodecahedral graph and was subsequently marketed in Europe in many forms.

The motivation for Hamilton was the problem of symmetries of an icosahedron, for which he invented icosians—an algebraic tool to compute the symmetries. The solution of the puzzle is a cycle containing twenty (in ancient Greek icosa) edges (i.e. a Hamiltonian circuit on the icosahedron).

a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle.

J: In 1857 Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865, known to every mathematician
for the quaternions and the theorem of Cayley–Hamilton) invented the
following Icosian game which he then sold to a London game dealer in 1859
for 25 pounds; it was realized physically as a pegboard with holes. The corners
of a regular dodecahedron are labelled with the names of cities; the task is
to find a circular tour along the edges of the dodecahedron visiting each city
exactly once, where sometimes the first steps of the tour might also be prescribed.
More about this game can be found in [BaCo87]. We may model the
Icosian game by looking for a cycle in the corresponding dodecahedral graph
which contains each vertex exactly once. Such a cycle is therefore called a
Hamiltonian cycle. In Figure 1.7 we give a solution for Hamilton’s original
problem.

<!-- Terminology -->

<text>
Historically, <i>linkages</i> was the term sometimes employed to refer to graphs. The graph term was later standardized by James Joseph Sylvester, a 19th-century British mathematician who founded the American Journal of Mathematics, the first mathematics journal in the United States <cite>Chartrand et al. 2011</cite>.

<title>Social networks</title>

<text>
Widely used in the social and behavioral sciences, social network analysis focuses on the relationships among social entities <cite>Wasserman and Faust 1994</cite>. Depending on the particular context, these social entities can be individuals belonging to groups, corporations making economic transactions with other corporations, or nations signing treaties and trade agreements. The key ingredient in social network analysis is its focus on relationships, in contrast to reductionist approaches that limit their attention to the attributes of individual social entities.
</text>

<text>
Kinds of relations in a social network: 
- John Barnes (1972): attitudes, roles, and transactions.
- Knoke/Kuklinski (1982): individual evaluations (sentiments: friendship, liking, respect...), kinship (family ties: marriage and descent relationships), transactions or transfers of material resources (lending/borrowing, buying/selling, exchange of gifts), transfer of non-material resources (communication, i.e. sending/receiving information, let it be e-mail messages, advice, or mere gossip), interactions (e.g. attending the same event, hitting...), movement (physical, between locations, or social, between occupations), formal roles (boss/employee, teacher/student, doctor/patient...)...
</text>


<text>
Topics that have been studied by network analysts: occupational mobility, decision making, group problem solving, consensus and social influence, social perception, social support, community formation, exchange and power, social roles, coalition formation, company interlocking, markets, the world economic system, difussion and adoption of innovations...
</text>

<text>
Ego-centered networks (a.k.a. personal or local networks) consist of a focal actor, called ego, a set of alters who have ties to ego, and measurements on the ties among the alters, e.g. Facebook friends or people in your Google+ circles [difference between dichotomous links @Facebook vs. valued links @Google+, e.g. trusty friend, well-known, acquaintance, name associated to face, unknown]. Applications: study of the social envionment surrounding a given individual (you!) and what social scientists call social support, i.e. how social relationships can affect the emotional and physical well-being of a given individual.

Two students of Leslie White, a renowned anthropologists, offer complementary views on the forces behind cooperation [of people within societies].
<cite>Wright 2000</cite>. Whereas Robert Carneiro's focus was on pushing people together as the rational response against external threats, Elman Service thought that it was clear in some cases and probable in many others that neighboring societies were pulled together because of economic causes. Either by pushing or pulling people, opportunities for gain originate and draw people in closer cooperation, because of the benefits of participation in the total network.

Jennifer Fewell, from Arizona State University, illustrates the importance of [insect] social networking using a professional basketball example <cite>Fewell and O'Donnell 2009</cite>. Phoenix Suns were successful, in part, because point guard Steve Nash passed the ball quickly to different teammates, making it difficult for defenders to predict their play. However, the Suns immediately started losing the first six games after Shaquille O'Neal joined the team, most likely because he destroyed his team's network dynamics: <q>Everybody there on the floor... knew where that ball was going to go - it was going to go to Shaq.</q> The network dynamics had changed and the success of the team depended on it, so they were forced to change their network dynamics again in order to improve their results with Shaquille O'Neal in the team. <q>It's a good example that the success of individuals depend on the network, and the success of the network depends on individuals. It's not just how good the individuals are... it's how good those interactions among them are as well.</q>

The first use of the <q>social network</q> term is often attributed to John Arundel Barnes <cite>Barnes 1954</cite>, an anthropologist who conducted a field study to analyze the social structure and decision-making processes in Bremnes, a small island in western Norway. Since then, social networks denote patterns of ties that encompass many concepts used by the social sciences, including bounded groups (e.g., tribes or families) and social categories (e.g., gender or ethnicity).
</text>

<text>
Sociometry can be considered to be the precursor of social network analysis (and much of social psychology), as it was founded to measure interpersonal relations in small groups of people. Jacob Levy Moreno, the founder of sociometry, also pioneered the use of <q>sociograms</q> in the 1930's, e.g. <cite>Moreno and Jennings 1938</cite>. Sociograms are standard graph drawings used to depict the social links that determine the interpersonal structure of groups.
