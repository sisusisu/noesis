<cite>Han et al. 2011</cite>: Role Discovery and Link Prediction in Information Networks

There exist many hidden roles or relationships among different nodes/links in a heterogeneous network. Examples include advisor–advisee and leader–follower relationships in a research publication network. To discover such hidden roles or relationships, experts can specify constraints based on their background knowledge. Enforcing such constraints may help cross-checking and validation in large interconnected networks. Information redundancy in a network can often be used to help weed out objects/links that do not follow such constraints.

Similarly, link prediction can be performed based on the assessment of the ranking of the expected relationships among the candidate nodes/links. For example, we may predict which papers an author may write, read, or cite, based on the author's recent publication history and the trend of research on similar topics. Such studies often require analyzing the proximity of network nodes/links and the trends and connections of their similar neighbors. Roughly speaking, people refer to link prediction as link mining; however, link mining covers additional tasks includinglink-based object classification, object type prediction, link type prediction, link existence prediction, link cardinality estimation, and object reconciliation (which predicts whether two objects are, in fact, the same). It also includes group detection (which clusters objects), as well as subgraph identification (which finds characteristic subgraphs within networks) and metadata mining (which uncovers schema-type information regarding unstructured data)


Clustering and Classification of Graphs and Homogeneous Networks

Large graphs and networks have cohesive structures, which are often hidden among their massive, interconnected nodes and links. Cluster analysis methods have been developed on large networks to uncover network structures, discover hidden communities, hubs, and outliers based on network topological structures and their associated properties. Various kinds of network clustering methods have been developed and can be categorized as either partitioning, hierarchical, or density-based algorithms. Moreover, given human-labeled training data, the discovery of network structures can be guided by human-specified heuristic constraints. Supervised classification and semi-supervised classification of networks are recent hot topics in the data mining research community.

Clustering, Ranking, and Classification of Heterogeneous Networks

A heterogeneous network contains interconnected nodes and links of different types. Such interconnected structures contain rich information, which can be used to mutually enhance nodes and links, and propagate knowledge from one type to another. Clustering and ranking of such heterogeneous networks can be performed hand-in-hand in the context that highly ranked nodes/links in a cluster may contribute more than their lower-ranked counterparts in the evaluation of the cohesiveness of a cluster. Clustering may help consolidate the high ranking of objects/links dedicated to the cluster. Such mutual enhancement of ranking and clustering prompted the development of an algorithm called RankClus. Moreover, users may specify different ranking rules or present labeled nodes/links for certain data types. Knowledge of one type can be propagated to other types. Such propagation reaches the nodes/links of the same type via heterogeneous-type connections. Algorithms have been developed for supervised learning and semi-supervised learning in heterogeneous networks.

Han: In link prediction, measures for analyzing the proximity of network nodes can be
used to predict and rank new links. Examples include the shortest path (which ranks
node pairs by their shortest path in the network) and common neighbors (where the
greater the number of neighbors that two nodes share, the more likely they are to
form a link). Other measures may be based on the ensemble of all paths between two
nodes.

<cite>Han et al. 2011</cite>:
Real-world data are often incomplete, noisy, uncertain, and unreliable. Information redundancy may exist among the multiple pieces of data that are interconnected in a large network. Information redundancy can be explored in such networks to perform quality data cleaning, data integration, information validation, and trustability analysis by network analysis. For example, we can distinguish authors who share the same names by examining the networked connections with other heterogeneous objects such as coauthors, publication venues, and terms. In addition, we can identify inaccurate author
information presented by booksellers by exploring a network built based on author information provided by multiple booksellers.

Sophisticated information network analysis methods have been developed in this direction, and in many cases, portions of the data serve as the “training set.” That is, relatively clean and reliable data or a consensus of data from multiple information providers can be used to help consolidate the remaining, unreliable portions of the data. This reduces the costly efforts of labeling the data by hand and of training on massive, dynamic, real-world data sets.
