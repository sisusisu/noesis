<title>Clustering coefficient</title>

<text>
The clustering coefficient of an individual node measure the density of connections among the node's neighbors <cite>Watts and Strogatz 1998</cite>. Densely connected neighborhoods form clusters around a node.
</text>

<text>
The clustering coefficient measures how many nodes form triangular subgraphs with their adjacent nodes. In its original form, the clustering coefficient is the fraction of fully connected triangles among the node and its neighbors (a.k.a. three-node motifs). The clustering coefficient, therefore, measures how the neighbors of a node are interconnected.
</text>

<text>
L: In social network analysis, high clustering means that friends of friends are linked to one another. It is network science’s way of saying, “Birds of a feather, flock together.”
</text>

<text>
L: Suppose that we compare the number of links connecting a group of k adjacent nodes
to the maximum possible number,which is given by a complete subgraph with (k(k.))/2 links. 
Each subgraph formed around a node in this k-node neighborhood forms a triangular
subgraph if it is complete, and does not form a triangular subgraph if one or
more links is (are) missing. The amount of clustering depends on the number of triangles
found among these neighbors. Let the neighbors of node u be the nodes directly connected
to u. There are degree(u) such neighbors, which means that there are potentially
(degree(u) [degree(u)-1])/2 links among these neighbors. Suppose that the neighbors
share c links; then the cluster coefficient of node u, CC(u), is

CC(u) = 2c / ( degree(u) (degree(u) - 1) )

A more visual way to think of cluster coefficient is the following: A node u with degree(u)
neighbors may be part of c triangular subgraphs, each containing node u as one of the
triangle’s three nodes. Cluster coefficient is the ratio of the actual number of triangular
subgraphs c to the maximum possible number.
</text>

<text>
The clustering coefficient of can be interpreted as the probability that two of its neighbors are adjacent in the network. However, this probability often depends on the node degree. Hence it is often expressed as a degree-dependent function:
</text>

<equation>
C(k) = \langle CC(u)|_{degree(u)=k} \rangle
</equation>


<text>
The cluster coefficient of the whole network CC(G) is the average over all node clustering
coefficients. It is less informative, but it is often employed.
The clustering coefficient reaches it maximum for complete graphs CC(K_n) = 1 and its minimum for trees CC(T)=0 (e.g. stars).
</text>

<text>
Sometimes, the clustering coefficient just counts (three times) the number of triangles in the network, a measure known as transitivity by sociologists:
</text>

<equation>
transitivity(G) = 3 \frac{ \#triangles }{ \#connectedTriples }
</equation>

<text>
It should be noted that each triangle consists of three connected triples, hence the constant 3 in the expression above. The number of connected triples of nodes equals <eqn>\sum_i d_i(d_i-1)/2</eqn> <eqn>= n ( \langle d^2 \rangle - \langle d \rangle)/2</eqn>. Finally, the number of triangles <eqn>T</eqn> can be computed from the adjacency matrix as follows:
</text>

<equation>
T = \frac{1}{6} \sum_i a_{ii}^{(3)} = \frac{1}{6} Tr A^3
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>Tr A^3</eqn> is the trace (the sum of the diagonal elements) of the cube of the graph adjacency matrix.
</text>


<text>
Low-degree nodes can disproportionately influence their neighbors' clustering coefficients, a problem solved by transitivity <cite>Newman 2003</cite>... a collectively normalized variant of the clustering coefficient.
</text>


<text>
Clustering coefficients and trasitivity have been generalized for weighted and directed networks <cite>Onnela et al. 2005</cite> <cite>Fagiolo 2007</cite>.
</text>

<text>
Clustering (segregation) - efficiency (integration) trade-off... Optimal clustering and modularity are incompatible with optimal global efficiency (separate communities do not communicate too much). Local vs. global order (e.g. specialization of subsystems).

<title>Modularity</title>


<text>
Networks with high levels of clustering are often composed of local communities or modules, which consist of densely connected sets of nodes. A module is separated from other modules in the sense that most links connect nodes within the module and only a few links extend beyond the module boundaries. </text>

<text>
A measure of network modularity characterizes the balance of within-module and between-modules connections.
