N'2003: All of the models discussed so far take observed properties
of real-world networks, such as degree sequences
or transitivity, and attempt to create networks that incorporate
those properties. The models do not however
help us to understand how networks come to have those
properties in the first place. In this section we examine
a class of models whose primary goal is to explain
network properties. In these models, the networks typically
grow by the gradual addition of vertices and edges
in some manner intended to reflect growth processes that
might be taking place on the real networks, and it is these
growth processes that lead to the characteristic structural
features of the network.

<text>
++ An alternative and intriguing idea, which has so far not been in-
vestigated in much depth, is that features such as power-law de-
gree distributions may arise through network optimization. See...

Anthropologists such as Elman Service, when studying cultural evolution, envision chiefdoms being formed when several villages were bound by commerce.

A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution obeys a power law, p(k) \sim k^{-q}, where k is the degree and q is an exponent typically between 2 and 3. Informally, a scale-free network is one with a small but significant number of nodes with a high degree and a large majority of nodes with a low degree. The nodes with high degree are called hubs. 
...
Scale-free networks are networks with hubs, which skew the degree distribution of the network.
...
Key properties not shared by other networks: 
- hubs 
</text>

<text>
A wide range of real-world networks have been found to exhibit power-law degree distributions: the World Wide Web, citation networks, cellular metabolism networks... 


L: Barabasi, Albert, and Jeong (Barabasi, 1999) argued that random or small-world network classes fail to model some real-world systems because they assume that the number of nodes n is set prior to activation of the underlying microrules. Real networks are dynamic, not static and therefore should be modeled as growth phenomena... They grow from a few nodes to many millions of nodes through an evolutionary process called preferential attachment. In simple terms, preferential attachment is biased—not random—which leads to networks with hubs. These early researchers concluded that the dynamic nature of some real-world systems is better represented by networks that “unfairly” add nodes and links as they evolve into nonrandom semistructured networks

<text>
Preferential attachment derives its name from the fact that the probability of a new node attaching to an existing node is proportional to the degree of the existing node. The higher the degree, the more likely a new link will be attached to the node. Clearly, high-degreed nodes become more connected and low-degreed nodes become less connected as the network grows. The resulting degree distribution is skewed toward low degree, because an increasing number of nodes decrease in degree as a few nodes greatly increase in degree.

L: Yule first observed preferential attachment in evolution (Yule, 1925): Darwinian algorithm = Connect the new node to an existing node with probability proportional to the number of links already connected to the existing node, i.e. its degree
[Yule, G. U., A Mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. B 213:21-87 (1925).]
++ Yule-Simon distribution

L: the idea of nonrandomness as a factor in behavior and the connection between preferential attachment and nonrandom distributions occurred to Simon in 1955 [Simon, H. A., On a class of skew distribution functions, Biometrika 42(3/4):425-440 (1955).]
   ++ [Bornholdt, S. and Ebel, H., World Wide Web scaling exponent from Simon's 1955 model, Phys. Rev. E 64, 035104 (2001).]

  ++ Herbert Simon, who showed that power laws arise when \the rich get richer," when the amount you get goes up with the amount you already have. In sociology this is referred to as the Matthew effect, after the biblical edict, \For to every one that hath shall be given. . . " (Matthew 25:29). Price called it cumulative advantage. Today it is usually known under the name preferential attachment, coined by Barabasi and Albert.
  [Merton, R. K., The Matthew effect in science, Science 159, 56{63 (1968).]



L: the earliest definition of preferential attachment, called cumulative advantage by Price (Price, 1965, 1976), explained the power-law property of scale-free networks before such networks were called scale-free. Price’s model was slightly different from the BA model. The BA procedure ignores link direction, while the Price model did not, and the BA model starts from scratch, while the Price model assumes an existing network. Nonetheless, preferential attachment and cumulative advantage are identical concepts.
[Price, D. J. de S., Networks of scientific papers, Science 149:510–515 (1965). ]
[Price, D. J. de S., A general theory of bibliometric and other cumulative advantage processes, J. Am. Soc. Inform. Sci. 27:292–306 (1976).]

  ++ N'2003: A the physicist-turned-historian-of-science Derek de Solla Price described in 1965 probably the rst example of what would now be called a scale-free network; he studied the network of citations between scientific papers and found that both in- and out-degrees (number of times a paper has been cited and number of other papers a paper cites) have power-law distributions...

  the resulting degree distribution has a power-law tail with exponent \alpha = 2 + 1/m, where m is  the mean in-degree of the network (which is also the the mean out-degree of the network)

  ++ N'2003: In fact, this is really only a half of the Matthew eect, since the same verse continues, \. . . but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away." In the processes studied by Simon and Price nothing is taken away from anyone. The full Matthew eect, with both the giving and the taking away, corresponds more closely to the Polya urn process than to Price's cumulative advantage. Price points out this distinction in his paper.


L: In fact, preferential attachment is known as the law of increasing returns in economics, adaptive
learning in artificial intelligence, and natural selection in biology. It is often
called “the rich get richer” (or the Matthew effect).
++ L: "a microrule called preferential attachment - that the probability a site will obtain a new link is directly proportional to the number of links it already has" (the <q>rich get richer</q> phenomenon).

1) a form of positive feedback that accelerates the acquisition of a commodity on the basis of the widespread or mainstream adoption of that commodity (increasing returns means a commodity becomes more valuable as it becomes more plentiful)

2) Adaptive learning in artificial intelligence: "Each response to a stimulus is
rewarded by increasing the probability that the same response will result from the
stimulus. Repetition increases the probability, which in turn increases the repetition
of the stimulus–response pair. Learning is a form of conditioning based on the
probability distribution established by repetition and positive feedback"

3) Natural selection is a similar process. In most species, stronger genes are replicated
in subsequent generations while weaker genes fade. The so-called fitness function of
an individual is akin to a power law—the more fit an individual is, the more likely it is
to survive, reproduce, and pass its genes on to the next generation. As fitness
increases, the gene is more likely to survive, and as survivability increases, so
does fitness. This feedback mechanism repeats many times, usually in extremely
small increments. Over time, fitter individuals emerge from weaker ancestors.


L: Preferential attachment describes an emergent process—that is, a process that results in a network topology that is not apparent by examination of the local algorithm, or microrule. It is not at all obvious that the result of repeated application of preferential attachment will result in a network with a degree distribution that follows a power law. This realization would come 70 years later, when A.-L. Barabasi and R. Albert showed how to create a scale-free network by repeated application of preferential attachment.

<text>

Network model based on their observations on the World Wide Web
- Small-world models operate only on sparse graphs.
- Highly connected sites dominate the Web.
- Distribution of the coordination numbers of sites is not bimodal but follows power-law.
- Does not show clustering which is present in the Web as well.

Network creation algorithm
- Start with a random network
- Take two vertex at random and add a link if it brings the distribution of z nearer to power-law
- Continue until correct coordination numbers reached
- Still otherwise a random graph

The network could also be created by generating N vertices with lines out of them according to power-law distribution and joining lines randomly until none are left.



[Barabasi, A.-L., R. Albert, and H. Jeong, Emergence of scaling in random networks, Science 286:509–512 (1999).]
demonstrated that power-law degree distributions can be generated by a <q>preferential attachment</q> growth process... the preferential attachment rule, which states that the probability of a link connecting node pairs is proportional to the degree of the new node.

L: random networks obey a uniformly random attachment rule, whereby the probability of attachment of a link to a pair of nodes is uniformly random... 
Instead of sampling from a uniformly random distribution, the Barabasi–Albert (BA) generative procedure creates dynamic networks by sampling from the degree distribution of network G at timestep t, namely, g0(t). The probability of a high-degreed node obtaining a subsequent link continues to rise as new nodes and links are added. The probability of a low-degreed node obtaining a subsequent link declines, so that over time, “popular nodes” become more popular, and out-of-favor nodes become less popular.

  (1) Growth: Starting with a small number (m_0) of vertices, at every time step we add a new vertex with m (\leq m_0) edges (that will be connected to the vertices already present in the system).

  (2) Preferential attachment: When choosing the vertices to which the new vertex connects, we assume that the probability P that a new vertex will be connected to vertex i depends on the connectivity k_i of that vertex, such that P(k_i) = k_i / \sum_j k_j

  (3) After t time steps the model leads to a random network with N = t + m_0 vertices and mt edges.

<text>
BA generative procedure begins with a “triangular network” consisting of three nodes and three links, and then attaches a new node to as many as Dm other nodes by preferential attachment. setting n_0 = m_0 = 3, and substituting m for \Delta m to avoid confusion with the total number of links in a network...
Starting with n = 3 nodes, each of the remaining (n - 3) nodes are attached to the network by adding \Delta m links to existing nodes. For sufficiently large networks and sufficiently small \Delta m, m is approximately (\Delta m)n, and the degree distribution obeys a power law of the form p(k) \sim k^{-3}.
</text>

<text>
Parameters:
\Delta m = number of links to add to each new node;
n = desired network size.


L: The BA scale-free network is generated by repeated application of a simple dynamic network construction algorithm:

  1. Starting with three nodes and three links, grow the network by adding one node at each timestep t.
  2. Link the new node to \Delta m other nodes using preferential attachment.
  3. Repeat this until all n nodes have been added to the network.

This takes an additional t = (n - 3) steps to add (n - 3) additional nodes to the initial three nodes and three links. In the early stages of formation, fewer than \Delta m links are added because network size n is too small. When n &lt; Dm, only n links are added. Thus, at the end of the growth stage, the scale-free network has
</text>

<equation>
m = (\Delta m) n - \sum_{i=1}{\Delta m} i = (\Delta m) n - \frac{ \Delta m ( \Delta m - 1)} {2}
</equation>

<text>
IMPLEMENTING PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT

L: Of particular interest is the method of finding a replacement node when the node
selected by preferential attachment leads to a duplicate link. When this happens, the
code rolls variable j forward, seeking a node with higher index. This is achieved by
incrementing j until it exceeds nNodes, and then starting over again with node 0.

1. select an existing head node u by sampling from the degree cumulative distribution function CDF(i) defined by

CDF(i) = \sum_{j=1}{i} \frac {d(n_j)}{total}

where total is given by the current number of nodes in the network

ii. Let r be a uniform random number from [0,1). Then u is a random variate sampled from CDF(i) as follows:
CDF(u - 1) \geq r \geq CDF(u);

iii. Connect v with u, taking care to avoid duplicate links.


NOTE: CDF is recomputed each time a new node is added because total number of links and node degrees change after each insertion.
</text>


N'2002: A naive simulation of the preferential attachment process is quite inefficient. In order to attach to a vertex in
proportion to its degree we normally need to examine the degrees of all vertices in turn, a process that takes O(n) time for each step of the algorithm. Thus the generation of a graph of size n would take O(n^2) steps overall. A much better procedure, which works in O(1) time per
step and O(n) time overall, is the following. We maintain a list, in an integer array for instance, that includes ki entries of value i for each vertex i. Thus, for example, a network of four vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 with degrees 2, 1, 1, and 3, respectively could be represented
by the array (1; 1; 2; 3; 4; 4; 4). Then in order to choose a target vertex for a new edge with the correct preferential attachment, one simply chooses a number at random from this list. Of course, the list must be updated as new vertices and edges are added, but this is simple. Notice
that there is no requirement that the items in the list be in any particular order. If we add a new vertex 5 to our network above, for example, with degree 1 and one edge that connects it to vertex 2, the list can be updated by adding new items to the end, so that it reads
(1; 1; 1; 2; 3; 4; 4; 4; 5; 2). And so forth.

An alternative method for simulating the model of
Barabasi and Albert has been described by Krapivsky
and Redner
[Krapivsky, P. L. and Redner, S., Organization of growing random networks, Phys. Rev. E 63, 066123 (2001).]

Their method uses the network structure itself in place of the list of vertices above and works as follows. The model is regarded as a directed network in which there are exactly m edges running out of each vertex, pointing to others. We first pick a vertex at random from the graph and then with some probability we either keep that vertex or we \redirect" to one of its neighbors, meaning that we pick at random one of the vertices it points to. Since each vertex has exactly m outgoing edges, the latter operation is equivalent to choosing an edge at random from the graph and following it, and hence alights on a target vertex with probability proportional to the in-degree j of that target (because there are j ways to arrive at a vertex of in-degree j). Thus the total probability of selecting any given vertex is proportional to j + c, where c is some constant. However, since the out-degree of all vertices is simply m, the total degree is k = j +m and the selection probability is therefore also proportional to k + c .. m. By choosing the probability of redirection appropriately, we can arrange for the constant c to be equal to m, and hence for the probability of selecting a vertex to be simply proportional to k. Since it does not require an extra array for the vertex list, this method of simulation is more
memory efficient than the previous method, although it is slightly more complicated to implement.

<title>Random resampling</title>

<text>
Alternatives for roulette wheel selection 

A) Weight normalization + cumulative weights + single random U[0,1] for each new sample
O(n) for a single sample, O(n^2) for n samples, O(nlog n) for n samples if binary search is employed

B) Wheel + multiple calls to an uniform random number generator for each new sample
O(n) for a single sample in the worst case, O(n^2) for n samples in the worst case, i.e. a extremely skewed distribution
O(k) for a single sample in the average case, O(kn) for n samples in the average case
Faster than the standard roulette wheel selection, despite higher number of calls to RNG ???
++ "B is faster when the weights are uniformly distributed, and slower when they are exponentially distributed"

++ "the resampling wheel aims to take advantage of the fact that we are going to select a large number of particles at once as opposed to "a particle at a time"."
++ "tradeoff seems to be that you want as small an interval as possible to minimize the number of particles you visit on each step but still is sufficiently random to approximate the desired distribution. If the interval was very small then all of your samples would reside on a tiny slice of the wheel. If the interval is too large then you waste time "visiting." 2 * max(w) assures that you get at least one "new" particle per iteration of the algorithm. Why not use max(w) instead? That would bias the probability of choosing the larger elements because elements close to max(w) in size are essentially guaranteed to be selected"
i.e. 2*wmax is a somewhat arbitrary value that balances keeping the tries to keep the algorithm efficient without overly biasing the results.
i.e. if the increment was less than wmax, you would be guaranteed to select the highest probability particle so the results would definitely be biased. If the increment was 10*wmax, you would be looping through alot more particles and you algorithm would be less efficient.


C) Walker's alias method, slightly faster, especially if there are many samples. 
O(n) setup time using Vose's algorithm (makes sense if you do lots of sampling) + samples in O(1).
An implementation in python can be found @ <url>http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576564/</url>, 

Walker's algorithm essentially arranges a given lot of sticks into equal-length rows: pick a row shorter than average and a row longer than average, split the longer to fill the shorter, iterate until they're all the same length.


Walker's method involves setting up \magic" tables of length nn, where nn is the smallest power of 2 that is \geq n.

  - For \gamma &gt; 1 there is a \condensation" phenomenon, in which a single vertex gets a finite fraction of all the connections in the network
  - For \gamma &gt; 2, there is a non-zero probability that this \gel node" will be connected to every other vertex on the graph. The remainder of the vertices have an exponentially decaying degree distribution.

Another variation on the basic growing network theme is to make the mean degree change over time, Dorogovtsev and Mendes

Dorogovtsev and Mendes have proposed a model that adds to the standard Barabasi{Albert model an extra mechanism whereby edges appear and  disappear between pre-existing vertices with stochastically constant but possibly dierent rates.

Albert and Barabasi and Tadic have studied models in which edges can move around the network after they are added. These models can show both power-law and exponential degree distributions depending on the model parameters.

Adamic and Huberman have shown that the real World Wide Web does not have the correlations between age and degree of vertices that
are found in the model of Barabasi and Albert. Adamic and Huberman suggest that this is because the degree of vertices is also a function of their intrinsic worth; some Web sites are useful to more people than others and so gain links at a higher rate.

<title>Degree distribution</title>

<text>
L: ++ Before Barabasi-Albert model, most networks were thought to be random, with Poisson degree distributions.
</text>

<text>
<cite>Newman 2003</cite> proved that the scale-free network degree distribution, p(k) \sim k^{-3}, is a direct consequence of the change in the expected number of nodes with degree k after each new node is added.

A fraction of nodes with degree (k - 1) increase their degree to k, and another fraction of nodes increase their degree from k to (k + 1). The net change in fraction of nodes with degree k is the difference between these two.

we approximate the net change in nodes with degree k by observing that a new node is attached to the network by Dm links, which transitions
a fraction of nodes of degree (k - 1) to nodes of k degrees, and another fraction of nodes of degree k to nodes of (k + 1) degree. The difference between the distribution before adding a node and after adding a node is averaged, which leads to a closed-form equation for p(k).

The derivation given by Newman makes a number of assumptions that may not be valid for all scale-free networks. For example, the derivation assumes linearity—the probability of link attachment varies directly proportional to the degree of the destination node. Alternately, the relationship could be proportional to the square of destination node degree, square root, and so on. Nonetheless, Newman’s linear model seems to give an accurate result for the BA generative procedure. 


Strategy:


1. Let <eqn>p_t(k)</eqn> represent the degree distribution at timestep <eqn>t</eqn>, and let <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> be the number of links attached each time a new node is added to the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network. One new node and <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> links are added at each timestep; hence the number of nodes with degree <eqn>k</eqn> at time <eqn>t</eqn> is <eqn>np_t(k)</eqn>, and the number of nodes with degree <eqn>k</eqn> at timestep <eqn>(t + 1)</eqn> is <eqn>(n + 1)p_{t+1}(k)</eqn>.

2. Using the degree distribution <eqn>p_t(k)</eqn> at timestep t, construct a meanfield equation expressing the expected change in number of nodes with degree k for a typical timestep. Note that the expected number of nodes with degree k after insertion of a new node is <eqn>\Delta m p_t(k - 1)</eqn>, and the expected number of nodes that no longer have degree k is <eqn>\Delta m p_t(k)</eqn> after the new node is inserted. In other words, some nodes transition from degree <eqn>(k - 1)</eqn> to <eqn>k</eqn>, and others transition from degree <eqn>k</eqn> to degree <eqn>(k + 1)</eqn>.

3. Solve the mean-field equation for the stationary (time-invariant) case, yielding <eqn>p(k)</eqn>. Time invariance means that <eqn>p_{t-1}(k) = p_t(k) = p(k)</eqn>. This is the so-called stationary process solution, which represents the final state of the scale-free network. <eqn>p(k)</eqn> is the degree distribution function after <eqn>n</eqn> nodes have been attached.
</text>

<text>
1. linear relation between probability of attachment and degree distribution.

The degree distribution <eqn>p_t(k)</eqn> is the fraction of nodes with degree k, at timestep t. Note that <eqn>\sum_k p_t(k) = 1</eqn>, which is independent of t. Preferential attachment uses this fraction to select the node with degree k that is linked to the new node with the following probability:
</text>

<equation>
\frac{ k p_t(k) } { \sum_k p_t(k) } =  \frac{ k p_t(k) } { \lambda }
</equation>

<text>
where <eqn>\lambda</eqn> is the average degree, as usual. We also know that <eqn>\lambda = 2(m/n)</eqn> for any network, and <eqn>m \approx n \Delta m</eqn>. Thus, the fraction of nodes with degree k is <eqn>(k p_t(k)) / (2 \Delta m)</eqn>, after substituting <eqn>\lambda \approx 2 \Delta m</eqn> into the equation for <eqn>p_t(k)</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
2. Mean-field equation that relates the “before”/“after” change in number of nodes with degree k

Change in number of nodes with degree k equals the number of nodes increased from degree (k - 1) to degree k, minus the number of nodes increased from degree k to degree (k + 1).
</text>

<text>
The left-hand side of the mean-field equation is the expected number of nodes with degree k after insertion of a new node, minus the number before insertion:
</text>

<equation>
(n+1) p_{t+1}(k) - n p_t(k)
</equation>

<text>
The right-hand-side is the expected number of links connecting to nodes with degree (k - 1) minus the number of nodes that are no longer of degree k because they increased to degree (k + 1):
</text>

<equation>
\Delta m (k - 1) \frac { p_t(k-1)} { 2 \Delta m } - \Delta m \frac { k p_t(k)} { 2 \Delta m }
</equation>

<text>
which can be simplified to
</text>

<equation>
(k - 1) \frac { p_t(k-1)} { 2 } - \frac { k p_t(k)} { 2 }
</equation>

<text>
The time-varying mean-field equation for <eqn>k &gt; \Delta m</eqn> is
</text>

<equation>
(n+1) p_{t+1}(k) - n p_t(k) = \frac {k-1} { 2 } p_t(k-1) - \frac { k } { 2 } p_t(k)
</equation>

<text>
Since there are no nodes with a degree lower than <eqn>\Delta m</eqn>, we know that <eqn>p(k)=0</eqn> for <eqn>k &lt; \Delta m</eqn>. For <eqn>k = \Delta m</eqn>, we obtain the following expression given that a single node increases its degree to <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> (i.e. the new one):
</text>

<equation>
(n+1) p_{t+1}(\Delta m) - n p_t(\Delta m) = 1 - \frac { \Delta m } { 2 } p_t(\Delta m)
</equation>


<text>
3. The stationary, or time-invariant solution, obtained by setting <eqn>p_{t+1}(k) = p_t(k) = p(k)</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
p(k) = \frac {k-1} { 2 } p(k-1) - \frac{k}{2} p(k) 
</equation>

<text>
for <eqn>k &gt; \Delta m</eqn>, and
</text>

<equation>
p(\Delta m) = 1 - \frac{\Delta m}{2} p(\Delta m)
</equation>

<text>
when <eqn>k = \Delta m</eqn>. Therefore
</text>

<equation>
p(\Delta m) = \frac{2}{\Delta m + 2}
</equation>

<text>
And, rearranging for <eqn>k &gt; \Delta m</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
p(k) = \frac {k-1} {k-2} p(k-1)
</equation>


<text>
Expanding the recurrence, we obtain
</text>

<equation>
p(k) = \frac{(k-1)(k-2)...\Delta m}{(k+2)(k+1)...(\Delta m+3)} p(\Delta m)
</equation>

<text>
which yields the solution for the degree distribution of the Barabasi-Albert model:
</text>

<equation>
p(k) = \frac{2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)}{(k+2)(k+1)k}
</equation>

<text>
For large <eqn>k</eqn> and constant <eqn>\Delta m</eqn>, <eqn>p(k)</eqn> is a power law with <eqn>q = 3</eqn>, since <eqn>p(k) \sim k^{-3}</eqn>.

++ Notice how the above determines the degree distribution regardless of the network size, which has no influence in the BA model.

Barabasi et al. (Barabasi, 1999) describe another alternative to the derivation given by Newman...
[Barabasi, A.-L., R. Albert, and H. Jeong, Emergence of scaling in random networks, Science 286:509–512 (1999).]
and <cite>Newman 2003</cite> discusses other solutions, yielding different values of q, based on different assumptions.
</text>


<text>
++ This derivation yields an exponent q=3 for BA scale-free networks, but in practice, a network is considered scale-free if 2 \leq q \leq 3. 
Technically, any value of q satisfies the scale-free relation p(\alpha k) = \beta p(k).

L: Networks whose degree distribution approximates a power law,
<eqn>p(k)=k^{-q}</eqn>, for some power <eqn>q &gt; 1</eqn>. 

L:Such graphs are called scale-free because the power-law distribution has no scale parameter; that is, the variance of a power-law is
infinite, versus the finite variance of most other distributions such as the Gaussian or normal distribution. Power laws are also sometimes called “fat tailed” because they do not decline as k increases as fast as an exponential or normal distribution.

Random graphs more or less distribute links uniformly across n nodes. But... scale-free graphs are lopsided - a vast number of nodes have only one or two links, while a rare few nodes have perhaps hundreds of links... 


scale-free graphs have less entropy than random graphs, but more than small worlds...
The entropy of a scale-free graph is generally lower than the entropy of a random
graph because scale-free networks contain some structure. Scale-free networks are closer to the random end of the "graph structure" spectrum
than to the structured extreme. At one end is the class of structured k-regular graphs
(where entropy equals zero), and the other end is the class of random networks that
have no discernable structure or topology. In between is the class of scale-free networks,
which have some structure, because the degree distribution obeys a power law.
</text>


<text>
A power law implies that the probability of finding a node with a degree that is twice as large as a given number decreases by a constant factor, rather than following an exponential falloff. 

L: Power-law distributions are not exponential distributions even though they appear
to be similar. The tail of an exponential distribution vanishes much faster. For this
reason, power-law distributions are often called “fat tail” distributions.

L: The power law  declines more slowly than the exponential distribution so commonly found to model phenomena in the physical world. 
k^-q &gt; exp(-qk)  for most values of 1 &lt; q &lt; 3. Even when the power-law function is
adjusted to match at k=1, the exponential function declines more rapidly as k increases. This is why power-law distributions are sometimes
called “long” or “fat tail” distributions.


The power law is related to Zipf’s, Pareto’s, and Yule–Simon’s laws, but is somewhat more general.

- Zipf’s law states that the frequency of a word w in the English language is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table: f(w) = c/(r(w)), where r(w) is the word’s rank and c is a constant.

- Pareto’s distribution—also known as the 80/20 rule—says that 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth. 

- The Yule–Simon distribution is asymptotic to a power law: f (k) * 1/k^{p+1}. Yule may have been the first modern scientist to identify
natural processes that follow a power law (Yule, 1925).

[Zipf, G. K., Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort, Addison-Wesley Press, Cambridge, MA, 1949.]

++ exponent of the power law distribution.

L: "the probability that a site has k links obeys a power law, which drops off quickly for large k"
... A network that follows a power-law distribution means that it has a
hub, and many other nodes with many fewer links than the average. This lopsided
preference for hubs seemed counter to nature, which typically follows a normal distribution.
</text>


<text>
L: A scale-free graph has many nodes with very low degree, and one node with very
high degree. Hence, its degree distribution is skewed to the left—toward small degree
values. Because so many nodes are connected to the graph’s hub node, the scale-free
graph also exhibits a small graph diameter—similar to a random graph. It is nearly
one-half the diameter of the small-world graph, and 50% smaller than the diameter
of a random graph. This is a consequence of the high concentration of links attached
to the hub. The unexpectedly large hub degree is a distinguishing property of scalefree
graphs.
</text>

<text>
IDEA: The fluctuations in degree are unbounded, i.e., the standard deviation is bounded only by the finite size of the graph.
</text>


<text>
The <q>scale-free</q> term refers to the fact that nodes in a scale-free network do not have a characteristic scale. You can zoom in on any segment of the distribution and it does not change its shape.

L: scale-free networks... The name came from observing that a function f(x) scales if f(ax) = a*f(x), which is
what a power law does. Therefore, if the degree distribution obeys the power law, p(x) = x ^-q, then it is clear that p(ax) = (ax)^-q = (a ^-q)p(x) = a' p(x).

L: Any function that obeys the relation p(\alpha k) = \beta p(k), for constants \alpha and \beta, is considered scale-free because scaling the x axis (independent variable) by a constant factor \alpha, results in scaling the y axis (dependent variable) also by a constant factor \beta. 
In this case, \beta = \alpha ^q, which is a constant relative to k. The effect of scaling the independent variable by a constant factor of a is to move the powerlaw curve up or down vertically, but does not change the shape or range of the curve...

<text>
The density of a canonical BA scale-free network depends on the preferential attachment parameter \Delta m, which is the number of links used to attach each new node to other nodes during construction. This parameter determines the number of links in BA scale-free networks and, therefore, their density

m = (\Delta m) n -  \frac{ \Delta m ( \Delta m - 1)} {2}

<title>Hub degree</title>

<text>
Hubs are the predominant feature of scale-free networks...
</text>

<text>
As the number of available links increases, so does the degree of the network's largest hub. In other words, the largest hub degree is expected to increase with density. 
</text>


<text>
The maximum degree d_max of a vertex in a network will in general depend on the size of the network. In work on scale-free networks, Aiello et al.
assumed that the maximum degree was approximately the value above which there is less than one vertex of that degree in the graph on average, i.e., the point where <eqn>np_k = 1</eqn>. This means, for instance, that kmax \sim n^{1-\alpha} for the power-law degree distribution p_k \sim k^{-\alpha}. This assumption often underestimates the higher degree, as discussed by Adamic et al. 
[Aiello, W., Chung, F., and Lu, L., A random graph model for massive graphs, in Proceedings of the 32nd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 171{180, Association of Computing Machinery, New York (2000).]

</text>

<text>
We can also estimate the largest hub degree by solving a differential equation that relates rate of change in hub degree to the network density <cite>Lewis 2009</cite>:
</text>

<equation>
\frac{ \delta d_{max}(t) } { \delta t } = \rho
</equation>

<equation>
\frac{ \delta d_{max}(t) } { \delta t } = \frac{2m(t)}{n(t) ( n(t)+1 )}
</equation>

<text>
Since <eqn>\Delta m \approx m(t) / n(t)</eqn> and <eqn>n(t) \approx n(t+1)</eqn> for large values of <eqn>t</eqn>, we get
</text>

<equation>
\frac{ \delta d_{max}(t) } { \delta t } = \frac{2\Delta m}{n(t)}
</equation>

<text>
Integrating from 1 to n, we obtain
</text>

<equation>
d_{max}(t) = 2 \Delta m \ln n(t)
</equation>

<text>
which means that the largest node degree is given by:
</text>

<equation>
d_{max} = 2 \Delta m \ln n \sim \ln n
</equation>

<text>
L: The largest node degree grows with the network size, as expected, for both random and scale-free networks, but the rate of increase is much greater for a scale-free network.
</text>


<text>
L: ... limitations ...  because competition among the highest-degreed nodes in a very sparse network siphons off links from preferred nodes; that is, as density decreases (corresponding to increases in size, n), preference for the hub with the highest degree is overcome by the shortage of links. Because of this shortage, links must be acquired by competition among many high-degreed nodes. At some point, there simply aren’t enough links to go around, which limits logarithmic growth of hub degree.
</text>

<text>
A better approximation for the largest hub degree is given in <cite>Newman 2003</cite> for power-law distributions where <eqn>p_k \sim k^{-\alpha}</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
d_{max} \sim n^{1/(\alpha - 1)}
</equation>

<text>
which agrees with the intuition behind the empirical quadratic approximation made by <cite>Lewis 2009</cite> for the Barabasi-Albert model, where <eqn>\alpha = 3</eqn> and, therefore, <eqn>d_{max} \sim \sqrt{n}</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
Cohen et al. employs a simple rule of thumb that leads to the same result: the maximum degree is roughly the value of k that solves np_k = 1. However, as shown by Dorogovtsev and Samukhin, the fluctuations in the tail of the degree distribution are very large for the power-law case. Dorogovtsev et al. have also shown that the above expression holds for Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks and a detailed numerical study can be found in  Moreira et al..

<title>Entropy</title>

<text>
Since the degree distribution of a scale-free network follows a power low, it is possible to derive a closed-form equation for its entropy:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
H(SF) &amp; = - \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} p(k) \log_2 p(k) dk \\
      &amp; = - \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} 2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1) k^{-3} \log_2 \left( 2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1) k^{-3} \right) dk
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
Setting <eqn>\alpha = 2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
H(SF) &amp; = - \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \alpha k^{-3} \log_2 \left( \alpha k^{-3} \right) dk \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} k^{-3} \ln \left( \alpha k^{-3} \right) dk \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln \alpha - \ln k^3}{k^3} dk \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln \alpha - 3 \ln k}{k^3} dk \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \left[ \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln \alpha}{k^3} dk - 3 \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln k}{k^3} dk \right]
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
The first integral is easy to solve:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln \alpha}{k^3} dk &amp; = \frac{\ln \alpha}{2 \Delta m^2}
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
For the second term, we resort to integration by parts, using <eqn>u=\ln k</eqn>, <eqn>dv=k^{-3} dk</eqn>, <eqn>du=(1/k) dk = k^{-1} dk</eqn>, and <eqn>v=(-1/2k^2)</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{\ln k}{k^3} dk 
  &amp; = uv - \int vdu \\
  &amp; = - \frac{\ln k}{2k^2} - \int \frac{-1}{2k^2} \frac{1}{k} dk \\
  &amp; = - \frac{\ln k}{2k^2} - \int \frac{-1}{2k^3} dk \\
  &amp; = - \frac{\ln k}{2k^2} + \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{k^3} dk \\
  &amp; = - \frac{\ln k}{2k^2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{-1}{2k^2} \\
  &amp; = - \frac{\ln k}{2k^2} - \frac{1}{4k^2} \\
  &amp; = - \frac{2\ln k + 1}{4k^2} \\
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
Therefore,
</text>

<equation>
\int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln k}{k^3} dk = \frac{2\ln \Delta m + 1}{4 \Delta m^2} = \frac{\ln \Delta m + 1/2}{2 \Delta m^2}
</equation>

Combining both results, we obtain:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
H(SF) &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \left[ \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln \alpha}{k^3} dk 
                                          - 3 \int_{\Delta m}^{\infty} \frac{\ln k}{k^3} dk \right] \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \left[ \frac{\ln \alpha}{2 \Delta m^2}
                                          - 3 \frac{\ln \Delta m + 1/2}{2 \Delta m^2} \right] \\
      &amp; = \frac{-\alpha } {\ln 2} \frac{\ln \alpha - 3 (\ln \Delta m + 1/2)}{2\Delta m^2} \\
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
Now we recall that <eqn>\alpha = 2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)</eqn>:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
H(SF) &amp; = - \frac{2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)}{\ln 2} \frac{\ln (2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)) - 3(\ln \Delta m + 1/2)}{2 \Delta m^2} \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\ln 2} \frac{ \ln (2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)) - 3 \ln \Delta m - 3/2}{\Delta m} \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \frac{ \ln (2 \Delta m (\Delta m + 1)) - 3 \ln \Delta m - 3/2}{\ln 2} \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \frac{ \ln 2 + \ln \Delta m + \ln (\Delta m + 1) - 3 \ln \Delta m - 3/2}{\ln 2} \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \left( 1 + \log_2 \Delta m + \log_2 (\Delta m + 1) - 3 \log_2 \Delta m - \frac{3}{2\ln 2} \right) \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \left( 1 + \log_2 (\Delta m + 1) - 2 \log_2 \Delta m - \frac{3}{2\ln 2} \right) \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \left( 1 + \log_2 \frac{\Delta m + 1}{\Delta m^2} - \frac{3}{2\ln 2} \right) \\
      &amp; = - \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m} \left( \left( 1 - \frac{3}{2\ln 2} \right) + \log_2 \frac{\Delta m + 1}{\Delta m^2} \right)  \\
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
If we set <eqn>C = \frac{3}{2\ln 2} - 1 \approx 1.164</eqn> and <eqn>H_0 = \frac{\Delta m + 1} {\Delta m}</eqn>, we can simplify the above expression to:
</text>

<equation>
\begin{aligned}
H(SF) &amp; = H_0 \left( C + \log_2 \frac{\Delta m}{H_0} \right)
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<text>
for <eqn>2 \leq \Delta m \leq n-1</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
This result indicates that the entropy of the degree distribution for a Barabasi-Albert scale-free network depends exclusively on <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> and is independent of the network size. This entropy logarithmically increases with <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> and, since <eqn>\Delta m</eqn> is proportional to the network density, the entropy also increases with the logarithm of the network density. Unlike Poisson random networks, which become more structured as links are added to the network, entropy increases when we increase the density of scale-free networks.

Average path length of a scale-free network follows a logarithmic approximation rather than a power law.
L: Bollobas and Riordan report good approximation to large networks such as the Internet with a double-logarithmic approximation

<equation>
L(SF) = log (n) / log (log (n))
</equation>

<text>
L: The small path length of a scale-free network is due to its hubs—very high-degreed
nodes—rather than random links, acting as shortcuts.

L: The average path length of a (sparse) BA scale-free network is lower than the average path length of a (sparse) random network.
</text>



<text>
NOTE: Average path length linearly declines with hub degree
</text>

<text>
L: It is possible to control the path length of a scale-free network while simultaneously controlling the hub structure by changing density.

<tag>scale-free-clustering</tag>
<title>Clustering</title>

<text>
L: The cluster coefficient of a scale-free network generally varies inversely with n, and linearly with increase in density: CC(scale-free) \sim density. 

Barabasi claims that there is no analytic approximation of cluster coefficient for the BA-generated scale-free network, but suggests that it follows a power law: CC(scale-free) \sim n^{3/4}. 

Because the density of a scale-free network is approximately d \approx 2(\Delta m/n), the clustering coefficient also increases with \Delta m:
CC(scale-free) \sim \Delta m. 

The cluster coefficient of individual nodes is inversely proportional to the degree of individual nodes in a sparse scale-free network; hubs have low cluster coefficients, while non-hubs have high cluster coefficients. 

Cluster coefficient is bounded by \Delta m /(d -\Delta m) for low values of \Delta m.

<title>Betweenness</title>


<text>
L: The average betweenness of a scale-free network is determined by its density and the size of its largest hub:
</text>

<equation>
betweenness(SF) \sim \rho \lambda^r
</equation>

<text>
where
</text>

<equation>
r = \frac { log_2 (n - d_{hub}) } { log_2 \lambda }
</equation>

<text>
A a hub tends to directly connect to the majority of other nodes, therefore it tends to remove d_{hub} nodes from consideration as potential intermediaries. In terms of average betweenness, network classes are ranked as follows: random (highest), small-world (medium), and scale-free (lowest).

<cite>Clauset et al. 2009</cite> examine how power laws are best detected in practice: regression analysis of linear relationships in log-log scale (the standard method) results in many false positives (e.g. networks that might be better approximated by exponential or log-normal distributions). Sampling might also introduce false negatives <cite>Stumpf et al. 2005</cite>.

Many real-world networks have been shown to obey a power-law degree distribution rather than a binomial or Poisson distribution. 



Barabasi (Barabasi, 2001, 2002a, 2002b) and others <cite>Newman 2003</cite> (Adamic, 2000) have extensively studied networks with fat-tail distributions and found many applications of their theories in physical and biological sciences.

N'2003: A crucial element of both the models of Price and of Barabasi and Albert is the assumption of linear preferential attachment. It is worth asking whether there is any empirical evidence in support of this assumption. Two studies indicate that it may be a reasonable approximation to the truth:
 - Jeong et al. looked at the time evolution of citation networks, the Internet, and actor and scientist collaboration networks, and measured the number of new edges a vertex acquires in a single year as a function of the number of previously existing edges. They found that the one quantity was roughly proportional  to the other and hence concluded that linear preferential attachment was at work in these networks. 
 [Jeong, H., Neda, Z., and Barabasi, A.-L., Measuring preferential attachment in evolving networks, Europhys. Lett. 61, 567{572 (2003).]
 - Newman performed a similar study for scientific collaboration networks, but with finer time resolution, measured by the publication of individual papers, and came to similar conclusions.

EXAMPLES
distribution of number of papers published by scientists, distribution of cities by population, distribution of wealth, and
distribution of species among genera all obey a power law.

1999:
+ M. Faloutsos, P. Faloutsos, and C. Faloutsos observed a power law in their graph models of the Internet
+ Albert, Jeong, and Barabasi obtained similar results for the WWW

Many critical infrastructure systems such as the Internet, railroads, and
gas/oil pipeline systems have been shown to be scale-free 
[Lewis, Ted G., Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security: Defending a Networked Nation, Wiley, 2006]

Scale-free networks appear to model economic constructs such as the Internet and
monopolies within industrial segments, because preferential attachment is essentially
the law of increasing returns of economics.

INTERNET 

L: <cite>Broder et al. 2000</cite> analyzed over 200 million servers in the Internet’s Webgraph, and discovered its giant component, called the giant strongly connected component (GSCC). The Internet’s Webgraph is shaped like a “bowtie”—44 million nodes (21%) are predominantly incoming nodes that send messages such as email; another 44 million are predominantly outgoing nodes that receive messages. A larger cluster, 56 million (27%) make up the GSCC.

L: In terms of small-world effect (short average path length), GSCC is a small-world
network. The average path length (out of 56 million nodes in the GSCC) reported by
Broder et al. is a mere 16–20 hops! According to WWW high-level measurements
made by Adamic, of which the GSCC is a component, the average path length is 35 hops.
[Adamic, L. A., The small world web, in Research and Advanced Technology for
Digital Libraries, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1696, S. Abiteboul and
A.-M. Vercoustre, eds, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1999, 443–452.]

At the other extreme, Yook et al. estimates an average
path length equal to 9 hops when measured at the Internet’s router level 
[Yook, S. H., H. Jeong, A.-L. Barabasi, and Y. Tu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86:5835 (2001).]

L: GSCC path length is a consequence of hub topology (scale-free), not random rewiring (small-world). 

While clustering is modest in the domain-level Webgraph, Internet clustering is higher than expected of a purely random network. Yook et al. place the cluster coefficient of the domain level Internet in the range 0.18–0.30, versus 0.001 for an equivalent random network (Albert, 2002).
</text>

<text>
L: the pure power law may not always model of reality. 

Laherrere and Sornette suggest that a stretched exponential distribution may be more precise in natural and economic systems (Laherrere, 1998):
[Laherrere, J. and D. Sornette, Stretched exponential distributions in nature and economy: “Fat tails with characteristic scales,” Eur. Phys. J. B 2:525–539 (1998).]
</text>

<equation>
exp_{stretched}(x) = c \left( \frac { x_{c-1} } { x_0^c } \right) e^{ - \left( \frac{x}{x_0} \right) ^ c }
</equation>

<text>
Typically, exponent c is less than one. When c = 1, the stretched exponential is simply the well-known exponential distribution. Laherrere and Sornette list a number of natural and economic systems that obey this law: distribution of the 1300 largest earthquakes, temperature variations over the past 420,000 years, radio and light emissions from galaxies, oilfield reserve sizes, US and French company sizes, United Nations country sizes, citation distribution of the most frequently cited physicists, and the distribution of biological extinction events.

<title>The dynamics of scale-free networks</title>

<text>
L: Albert, Jeong, and Barabasi observed that scale-free networks were extremely resilient
against random attacks, but extremely vulnerable to systematic attacks on hubs
(Albert, 2000). This makes sense—a random attack will most likely strike and destroy
a node with only a few links, because a scale-free network has many such nodes. On
the contrary, since hubs are rare, it is unlikely that a hub is attacked. But a hub has
many links, and so its demise damages a large percentage of the network. Let pc
be the fraction of damaged nodes that dismantles the network. When pc is high,
the network is resilient, because many nodes must be knocked out to dismantle the
network. When it is low, the network is vulnerable. In simulations, Albert et al.
found threshold values of pc = 28% for random networks versus nearly 99% for
scale-free networks under random attacks; that is, a random network dismantles
when an average of 28% of its nodes are damaged. But the tables are turned when
hubs are systematically attacked—only 18% of the nodes need to be attacked to dismantle
a scale-free network. Thus, a scale-freenetwork is more vulnerable than a
random network when its hubs are targeted.

2000 Albert, Jeong, Barabasi: Scale-free networks are resilient if hubs are protected (Internet's "Achilles heel")
[Albert, R., H. Jeong, and A. L. Barabasi, The Internet's Achilles' heel: Error and attack tolerance of complex networks, Nature 406:378-382 (2000).]
</text>

<text>
L: In related work, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani observed that populations forming
a scale-free network have no minimum epidemic threshold that prevents an infectious
disease from recurring (Pastor-Satorras, 2001). Once an infection enters a network, it
rises and falls repeatedly. Persistent epidemics are real—they occur in human networks
as well as on the Internet.


2001 Pastor-Satorras, Vespignani: Claim no epidemic threshold in scale-free networks; Internet susceptible to SIS viruses
[Pastor-Satorras, R. and A. Vespignani, Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86(14):3200-3203 (2001).]
</text>

<text>
L: Wang and coworkers showed the initial claim of Pastor-Satorrus to be generally
false (Wang, 2003a). Instead, persistence of an infection is determined not by the network's
degree distribution but by its spectral radius, which is defined as the largest nontrivial
eigenvalue of a network's connection matrix. Therefore, network topology
determines its susceptibility to epidemics, but not because it is scale-free. This profound
result has significant implications for fighting both kinds of viruses—Internet
and human. It also has implications for the product marketer.
