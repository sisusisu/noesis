<cite>Sole and Valverde 2004</cite> arrange network classes in a qualitative space by considering three dimensions: randomness, heterogeneity, and modularity. The first introduces the amount of randomness involved in the process of network's building. The second measures how diverse is the link distribution and the third would measure how modular is the architecture. The position of different examples are only a visual guide. The domain
of highly heterogeneous, random hierarchical networks appears much more occupied than others. Scale-free like networks belong to this domain.

Each class results from a different formation process and exhibits different patterns of behavior. 

Not all niches in this space are occupied by real-world networks (empty regions might correspond to unrealistic growth strategies or unstable network configurations).
